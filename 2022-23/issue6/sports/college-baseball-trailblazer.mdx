On November 21, 2022, Brown University freshman Olivia Pichardo made history by becoming the first female Division 1 baseball player. As an 18-year-old right-handed pitcher and outfielder, Pichardo earned her spot on the Brown University baseball roster after an impressive few weeks of tryouts as a walk-on player. A girl from Queens, NY who fell in love with baseball at the age of five and had always dreamed of continuing her dream of playing baseball in college is now able to do so thanks to Brown Baseball head coach Grant Achilles. Achilles showed high praise for Pichardo as he watched her demonstrate her versatile athletic ability in the middle infield, outfield, and on the mound as she excelled with flying colors. Mentioning that Pichardo had “put together the most complete walk-on tryout [he] [has] seen from a player since becoming a head coach,” it’s been clear that Olivia Pichardo made a special impression on Coach Achilles, as well as all of division one college baseball. But how did Olivia get to this point and what does this mean for the future of college baseball?

As Olivia was growing up the odds were always stacked up against her. As the only female baseball player on all of her teams when she was younger, she was subject to microaggressions and insults that she would frequently hear while she was playing in her games. Though nobody was ever brave enough to insolently say anything to her face, her experiences bring a different perspective to a game she loves––not to mention motivation for her continued success.

Growing up and playing for her local Forest Hills little league team at five years old and continuing on to the travel baseball scene and other competitive tournaments, Olivia has come a long way to say the least. Her biggest accomplishment came during her sophomore year of high school at a tournament in Palm Beach, Florida, where her entire baseball team of girls took the gold medal in an international tournament against all boys. Defeating Puerto Rican and other national teams with some of the most talented players in the world was an eye-opening experience for Pichardo and her teammates and was the first instance in which she thought that her dream of playing collegiate baseball could be possible. After gaining acceptance in the fall to Brown University with an impressive 5.2 GPA out of high school, it seemed like only a matter of time before Olivia would be one out of only 31 players on Brown’s varsity baseball roster.

It is clear that Olivia Pichardo has blazed a trail of opportunities for herself and future female collegiate student athletes, but will this really mean we will see more female representation at the collegiate level? NCAA Division 1 athletics has seen a few female student athletes participate in predominantly male sports. Most recently, Vanderbilt’s women’s soccer goalkeeper Sarah Fuller kicked for the football team and received praise as the first female to do so in a power five college football game, but she also received violent and hateful backlash from others as well. Fast forward to 2023 and we still haven’t seen another female football player in power five football, and though Pichardo is the first to do it in the sport of baseball, it is unclear whether many will follow. The NCAA scholarship guidelines do not prohibit female athletes from receiving athletic scholarships in predominantly male sports, but as we have seen in the history of collegiate athletics, it has been incredibly challenging to do so. Whatever the future looks like, Olivia Pichardo has paved her own path to becoming a female sensation, inspiring pride, hope, and change for young female athletes while also earning a well deserved role on a division one collegiate baseball team for the first time in history. Congratulations, Olivia!
