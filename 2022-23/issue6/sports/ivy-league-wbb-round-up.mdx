Nearing February, collegiate basketball programs gear up for crucial mid-season matchups that dictate coveted playoff chances. Here is a look at the Ivy League Women’s Basketball scene and the race for the Ivy Tournament (as of January 18th).

Recently, I had the opportunity to photograph and film Harvard’s competitive home contest against Yale. Yale was able to squeeze out a tight victory over the Crimson with a final score of 71-70 in overtime, but there were key takeaways from both sides that I was able to gather. **Harvard Sophomore Harmoni Turner is the most talented player in the Ivy League.** She notched a light 26 points in Harvard’s home game and leads the Ivy League in scoring at 18.1 points per game, whilst also leading the race for Ivy League Player of the Year. Following a mediocre 7-7 conference finish last season, the Crimson seem poised to surpass last year’s performance this year. With a stellar supporting cast of established veterans like senior McKenzie Forbes (21-22 All-Ivy 2nd Team) and junior Lola Mullaney, other players have been proven capable of pouring in double-digit scoring numbers. Beyond the upperclassmen, Harvard has a promising future with a strong foundation in its underclassmen pool through star sophomore Turner, already leading the pack, and the newcomer freshman tandem of Gabrielle Anderson and Saniyah Glenn-Bello already locking in multiple starts this season. Sophomore Elena Rodriguez is also getting key minutes and starting multiple games for the Crimson. Rodriguez is shooting at an efficient 64% clip, placing her tied for first in the Ivy League for highest shooting success percentage. From top to bottom, Harvard has constructed a deep and talented roster that is destined for success this year, with high prospects of postseason success in the Ivy League Tournament.

Down in New Haven, the Yale Bulldogs have found success with new head coach, Dalila Eshe, in her first season with the team in spite of bumps to start the season. Faced with an early count of heavy adversity, Yale lost their star, unanimous All-Ivy selection and 1,000 point scorer Camilla Emsbo, to an abrupt season-ending injury, counting her out for her senior season. Emsbo was coming off a fantastic season in 2021-22, also leading Yale in blocks, double-doubles, and field goal percentage. Without the lone senior active for this season, Eshe has still managed to string together an impressive 4-1 record thus far with notable scoring contributions from junior Jenna Clark and freshman Kiley Capstraw, both averaging double figure scoring. Clark sits at first in the Ivy League in assists, averaging a generous 5.5 assists per game. **Having already overcome substantial amounts of difficulty to start the season, this gritty Yale squad shows no signs of slowing down.**

The all-time leading Ivy League Tournament champions, Princeton, have found themselves at a questionable 3-2 conference record this season, with losses coming from Harvard and Columbia, respectively. After a stellar 14-0 Ivy record last year and a national ranking of 25 in the country, expectations were at an all time high for the Princeton Tigers. Now with a slower start to the season, the Tigers still have the pieces to make a run for the Ivy Tournament. Junior Kaitlyn Chen leads the team both in scoring per game (14.1) and assists (4.4, 3rd in Ivy League). Fellow junior Ellie Mitchell has been a terror on the boards, averaging a monstrous 11.2 rebounds a game, good for first in the Ivy Conference. A team coming off a powerhouse season with the reigning Ivy Coach of the Year (Carla Berube) should not be overlooked; don’t rule out the Tigers just yet.

Coming off its winningest season in program history with a 12-2 conference record last year, the Columbia Lions will prove a fierce challenger at the Ivy Title. An experienced roster makeup of seven seniors and four juniors, the Lions sport a skillful group. Two-time All-Ivy selection, Abbey Hsu is cruising to 17.3 points per game, the second leading scorer in the league. The junior smashed the single-season league record for three pointers last season and continues to excel as their leading scorer. This explosive roster can pack a strong punch to carry them to legitimate postseason competition.

Narrowly missing a spot at the Ivy Tournament last year, Penn are aiming to carry over their current conference success. The Quakers have cruised to a 4-1 record with senior Kayla Padilla contributing 16 points per game. Now highly motivated and already finding impressive results, this Penn squad will fight for a bid into the Tournament.

After a 1-13 record last year, the Brown Bears are seeking to improve their conference standing in head coach Monique LeBlanc’s second season with the team. Junior Kyla Jones is a leading force for the struggling 1-4 conference team and she remains third in the Ivy League in scoring with 17.1 points per game.

Another team in a rebuild mode, sporting an identical 1-4 record, are the Cornell Big Red. With not many bright spots within the roster, the Big Red figure to finish near the bottom of the league table.

Now sitting at 0-5, the Dartmouth Big Green are statistically the worst team in the Ivy League Women’s Conference. After a poor 2-12 conference record last season for second worst (one game ahead of Brown), the Big Green have only seemed to regress further. An embarrassing 58-66 home loss to the reigning last place Brown has encapsulated Dartmouth’s performance thus far. With no players averaging double digit scoring numbers or any other particularly relevant statistics to note, Dartmouth has not shown any promise to start their 2022-23 campaign. Expect much of the same for the Big Green to continue for the rest of the season.

**With a plethora of talent and competitive fire, the rest of the Ivy League season should be an enthralling series to keep tabs on.**
