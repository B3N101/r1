“[I was looking] as to what I wanted to do with my skill set as a videographer and photographer, and Middlesex’s job was brand new, and I thought I could come into it and leave my mark,” said Austin Lewis. After an invaluable, roughly 2-year period working at Middlesex, he is departing our community for a new opportunity.

Lewis joined MX in the Spring of 2021 and remarked that it only took a month for him to “feel like [he] was comfortable and a part of everything,” a fact which he appreciated. He emphasized how the tight-knit community of Middlesex made him quickly feel at home.

Lewis’s position was new and experimental, allowing him to build it nearly from the ground up. Without hesitation, he dove in and started creating breathtaking videos for the Middlesex community. Lewis’s quality of videography and photography was incredible, and many Middlesex students asked to be interviewed, have their class videoed, or just be incidentally caught on camera.

The whole experience of being caught on Lewis’s camera and seeing yourself on Middlesex’s social media seemed to make people happy and bring everyone together, which Lewis describes as his “work’s biggest footprint.” He feels glad his work could “tighten the community,” he added.

Lucas Mylon ’23, a student well known for his skills in photography and videography on campus, echoed exactly what Lewis said, stating that Lewis “brought to the community his desire to help other students using his skills, and trying to foster the interest of other students” and that Lewis “was one of the reasons I pursued some of the stuff I did.” Mylon saw Lewis as “both a mentor and a coworker,” a relationship highlighting the incredible way Lewis taught and worked with students interested in photography or videography.

What’s Lewis’s secret to inspiring and helping Middlesex students turn their passions and hobbies into a reality? According to Lewis, it is as easy as “having a conversation.” It’s that simple. Lewis goes on to say that “there are so many [students] out there who are beyond talented and creative, and sometimes all it takes is just having a conversation to make sure that student knows that whatever it is that their doing isn’t just a hobby, that can be a profession.”

In fact, Lewis shared some great pieces of advice for anyone interested in exploring the field of digital media.

Lewis said, “YouTube should be anybody’s best friend.” Lewis explained, “oftentimes some of the best creatives…in the photo and video industry actually don't have any so-called ‘traditional education’ in the field.”

Lewis also mentioned that “If you don’t try it, you’re never going to learn it” and that “[Middlesex] is a massive opportunity for you to go out there and discover it all on your own, and if you have questions, go talk to Roan.” At this moment, Lewis refers to Roan Callahan, who works in the Visual Arts Department and is the Head of Lowell House at Middlesex.

Now accepting an incredible job position at Harvard, Lewis has moved on from his time at Middlesex. The Middlesex community wishes Lewis well in his new, incredible opportunity and next step in his digital media career.
