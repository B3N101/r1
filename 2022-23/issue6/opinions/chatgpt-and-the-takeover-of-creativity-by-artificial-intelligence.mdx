**Like the Sophia robot and self-driving cars before it, OpenAI’s November 30 release of _ChatGPT_ into the public sphere has added fuel to the already flaming-hot talk about the takeover of Artificial Intelligence.**

While AI has been steadily increasing for years, recent technological advances are making countless headlines for their perceived ability to replicate the one part of the human experience we thought impossible: creativity and complex thought. 

Through language recognition programs like _ChatGPT,_ AI can now produce limericks, poems, song lyrics, and essays. Via text-to-image, programs like _NightCafe_ can now present its users with beautiful artwork. 

Articles titled _“_AI will take 20% of all jobs within five YEARS,’ experts warn,” and “No, AI won’t reduce jobs. Here’s how platforms such as _ChatGPT_ will create new jobs — for humans,” published respectively in the _Daily Mail_ and _The Economic Times_, have only accentuated calamitous thinking surrounding pattern-recognition AI. These taglines read like the 90’s sci-fi novels where an army of evil robots rise up and destroy our lovely planet.	

**While catchy, this rhetoric of certainty and transformation is incredibly dangerous, for it depicts AI as an omniscient force out of humanity’s control.** Sure, we can pretend that we know what will happen, simplifying the issue, saying “AI will” and “AI won’t,” but the truth is, we simply don't know what will happen. While this uncertainty seems bleak, it actually enables us to take a deeper look at the competing forces that want to increase or limit the use of AI. If we understand these forces, we might just have a chance at actively shaping our futures. 

Before I jumped in, I wanted to test _ChatGPT_. I asked the bot to write a five paragraph response to the prompt, “How does Darcy and Elizabeth’s relationship evolve over the course of _Pride and Prejudice_? What does Austen suggest about love through this development?” The output I received lacked style, originality, and sophistication. Although the program can form grammatically coherent sentences, the essay was a repetitive jumble of buzzwords and cliche phrases. There were consistent blue sheets. Too many mentions of “also.” Too many unrelated points paired together with “and.” The bot was vague; it stated that Elizabeth began to “appreciate his (Darcy’s) good qualities,” but barely mentioned what those qualities were, or why she began to appreciate them. Even when prompted with very specific guidelines to write its own story, the bot creates basic, bland products. 

Yet _ChatGPT_ is only in its first edition. For now, basic content creators can use it for quick entertainment purposes or easy cash. Though if the technology substantially improves, as predicted, then high-up executives in the entertainment industry would likely replace some staff with chatbots; they could save money on employee salaries while producing more output. Moreover, many individuals believe that smaller creative workers, such as self-employed writers and artists, will soon likely be outcompeted. 

In truth, though, the takeover of AI in these jobs depends also on consumers and politicians. Many customers say they would be hesitant to read AI-generated books or purchase AI-generated art. I tend to agree. Although I would consume these sources to understand more about the topics, to me, these could not replace art and writing crafted by the human mind. AI cannot infuse its own lived experiences nor its unique perspective into its products. **Rich stories are born out of emotional depth and a desire to self-express – both of which these chatbots lack.**

Unfortunately, manufacturers and individuals can sell products without clarifying that they are AI-generated. Thus, those opposed to buying AI goods could accidentally buy them. And manipulated images and misinformation could be easily spread. Hopefully, politicians will create laws that mandate a disclosure of AI-use for creative purposes. 

Luckily, politicians have multiple motivations to regulate the commercial use of Artificial Intelligence. If unemployment rates surge, social issues are exacerbated: the rates of poverty, homelessness, and physical and mental illness increase. A society that values quickly produced, cheap goods over new, innovative ideas ultimately slows in education, progress, and wealth.

Pattern recognition AI is a legal mess. In one recent lawsuit, three artists filed a class action against _Stability AI, Midjourney_ and _DeviantArt_, for using their art to train bots. One of the artists, Sarah Andersen, was upset when her cartoon strips were revamped into crude political images that were then spread online. She says, “It’s clear from the way AI generators rolled out that there was never any consideration given to artists, our wishes, or our rights.” The future of AI is uncertain, but it will certainly be a complex tug-of-war between many layers of society.
