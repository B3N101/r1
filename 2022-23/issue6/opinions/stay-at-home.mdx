This year, my winter break started off as it normally would—apart from a Covid booster and flu vaccine that caused fairly intense symptoms! As soon as my family and I were feeling better, we drove 10 hours through Massachusetts and upstate New York, and over the border to Toronto. In the first few days of staying at my grandmother’s house, there were reports in the news of a terrible storm forecasted to hit our American neighbor: Buffalo. Sadly, in the following days, there were further reports about people who had perished.

These events bring up a question about natural disasters, and more specifically about the government's role in handling them. Why have 39 people died in Erie County due to the storm? Is it not the government's responsibility to protect its people? My simple answer is that although the situation is quite complex, I believe that the government did the best they could to serve and protect its people; the blame rather falls on the individuals who, unfortunately, perished in the midst of the blizzard.

The first relevant point that coincides with this year’s particular devastations has to do with the lingering pandemic: the government has a lack of management resources, and therefore they cannot provide an ideal response for their citizens. Buffalo and its respective county have experienced poverty for decades, and, fused with the pandemic, many citizens are not able to abandon their jobs in times of danger. If you want to live, you have to work.

Secondly, it was the holidays. And for me and many others, the holidays are about getting together with family. Even though people need to get out of the house to work and for the holidays, however, this is poor decision-making that is worth being held accountable.

Indeed, the government did impose various driving bans during and after the storm, and the local government even closed the Canadian/American border at Niagara Falls to prevent people from driving into dangerous conditions. Of the 39 individuals who perished, a majority of them died in their cars due to a lack of preparation, ignorance, and overconfidence. One’s safety should always, undoubtedly come first.

The type of situation I can most closely liken this tragedy to is that of a hurricane. Like customary winter storms in the Great Lakes and New England region, most people who live in America’s gulf region during a hurricane receive adequate aid from their governments before and after, every year. It is difficult to cope with severe natural disasters, but the governments do have successful regulatory strategies. However, sometimes the public feel that the storms will not affect them; perhaps in a hurricane one feels the need to stay in their house and not evacuate further inland, just like how one feels the need to go out of the house and not remain safe inside during a blizzard. I surely hope that next fall during the hurricane season and winter storm season, people will choose to prioritize their safety without second guessing themselves over other aspects of life.
