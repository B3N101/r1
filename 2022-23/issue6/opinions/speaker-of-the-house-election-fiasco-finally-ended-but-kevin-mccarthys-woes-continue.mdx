On January 7, now speaker Kevin McCarthy delivered his victory speech, announcing with pride and confidence his plans to enable “American families to live and enjoy the lives they deserve.” However, those empty promises cannot disguise the fact that it took McCarthy 15 votes, the longest since 1859, to even get elected as the speaker.

> **Top Democratic Representative from Massachusetts Jim McGovern said, “This rules package puts politics first, empowering the extremists who are only interested in their own power.”**

In the following two years, McCarthy will have to deal with a Republican house grasped by the far-right. When the 20 far-right holdouts refused to give McCarthy the votes he needed, he made a wide range of concessions that practically ensured the right-wing extremists absolute influence in the house. The number of members needed to call for a motion to vacate the speaker's chair is down to one, meaning that the following two years will be filled with an incessant challenge to the speaker. These concessions are indeed absurd, and no one knows what agreements are achieved behind closed doors.

McCarthy is clearly ready to make whatever concessions needed, despite the future of the house and the state, as long as they can get him in power. Led by a leader who has no morality nor true purpose and determination, it is safe to say that the House of Republicans will achieve nothing in the next two years.

In fact, the failure of the House of Republicans in the following two years is destined even before the ignominious election of speaker, when McCarthy unveiled the “Commitment to America,” his 2022 campaign agenda. The agenda highlights key challenges faced by the US, namely inflation, national security, energy crisis, but never once states any clear plans to address those problems. It is clear McCarthy never planned to actually bring about action. The promises are in name only.

Instead of focusing on forming practical plans, “Commitment to America” diverts public attention by attacking the Democrats. While “Commitment to America” is virtually based on information that attempts to convince people of the failures of the Democratic party, it conveniently obscures the fact that inflation and surging gas prices are results of unavoidable world-wide problems—COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war. It instead points to mistakes of the Biden administration.

The incessant conflict between the Republicans and Democrats has haunted the US for the past decades. The Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, encouraged by a party to attack its own country, marks the dramatic escalation of that tension to an unprecedented level where violence was used to challenge democracy. Two years have passed since then, and the fragmentation of the US still shows no signs of mitigation. It appears as if the purpose of both parties is no longer to improve the welfare of the people, but to defeat the other.

Fragmented and each absorbed in the lust for power, the politicians long abandoned their true purpose of serving the people. The past few years overflowed with economic distress, tense international relationships, and warfare have not ringed the bell for politicians, still unrepentant. If they continue to ignore their mistakes and ignore conscience, how can legislation be passed? How can the problems identified by “Commitment to America,” torturing American citizens for years, finally be resolved?
