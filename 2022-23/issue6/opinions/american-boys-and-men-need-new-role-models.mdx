Romanian police recently arrested online influencer Andrew Tate, who has been accused by numerous women in multiple countries of sex trafficking, sexual exploitation, and rape. His arrest is hardly a surprise: he has a long history of explicitly endorsing misogyny, rape, and the exploitation of women. His response was also predictable: “the matrix has attacked me,” Tate said as police escorted him in handcuffs. 

Andrew Tate is also a role model for young American men; in fact, firm Piper Sandler’s Fall 2022 survey of American teens reported that Andrew Tate ranked first among influencers. Kanye West ranked third. The attraction of American men to controversial figures is political as well as cultural: Donald Trump and QAnon are most popular by a long shot in the demographic of white men, especially those without a college education. 

Behind these men and their popularity is the same basic ideology, one which has become increasingly popular among American boys and men. The movement claims that you, a likely-working class, likely-white man are oppressed by a mysterious cabal. But there’s a man standing up to this cabal for you: it’s Donald Trump versus ‘the swamp,’ QAnon versus the ‘deep state,’ Andrew Tate and Kanye West versus ‘the matrix’. The movement’s rhetoric is usually reactionary, drawing on the ethos of an often imagined past. For Mr. Trump, it’s Make America Great Again, a compelling slogan given that a 2022 AP survey reported that 85% of American adults believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. For others, it’s a cultural past: Tate and other online figures often lament how “modernity” has corrupted, weakened, or otherwise restrained men. In one video, Andrew Tate explains that “modern men are weak” because “society tells them to be weak.” In another, the former professional kickboxer claims that “every single system is ‘femcentric’” and that Western society has become matriarchal because the “system” has “deliberately installed [emphasis added]” ideas in the minds of young men. Ironically, the macho leaders of the ideology, who detest in society what they see as a ‘culture of victimhood,’ make themselves the victim of their fiction. 

This setup is certainly not novel; in fact, it can be traced back more than a century to the antisemitic text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which claimed that a cabal of Jewish people are conspiring to control the world. The publication was written to intentionally villainize Jewish people, and it largely succeeded. The text influenced Nazism and lies that originate from it still circulate today. The notion of the ‘deep state,’ ‘swamp,’ and ‘matrix’ all carry an undertone of anti-semitism, whether explicit as with Kanye West or implicit as with others. 

The appeal of this ideology, however, is obvious. Men who struggle with anything from insecurity to money to dating can mistakenly draw inspiration from Mr. Trump or Andrew Tate. 

At face value, the two are unapologetically confident in word and action, immensely financially successful, and endlessly attractive to women. Reality, however, is not so kind. Their brash, egotistical sense of ‘confidence’ is hardly an example to be followed. One is a failure of a businessman while the other makes money through an exploitative webcam business and various other shady online schemes. Both face scores of allegations of sexual assault or rape. 

The danger, and perverse appeal of the movement, is that Mr. Trump, Andrew Tate, and other adherents falsely conflate the real and often hidden mental health struggles of American men with oppression by ‘modernity,’ women, or some other scapegoat. They dangerously mislead men to believe that gender equality means the oppression of men, that they themselves would be successful if only the cards weren’t stacked against them. The ideology promotes the dangerous notion that to be a man one must be violent, domineering, and inculpable. And it’s not only dangerous to outsiders—instead of inspiring a new generation of men, it reinforces the very scaffolds of shame that gave American men a suicide rate nearly four times higher than that of women. With a dearth of present fathers and male teachers, young men don’t need a scapegoat; they need role models. Mr. Trump, Andrew Tate, and Kanye West just won’t do.
