Zimbabwe’s upcoming presidential election in 2023, where Nelson Chamisa, leader of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), will challenge incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa, will likely be bloodier than the crisis in 2008, where hundreds of opposition members died in election-related violence. Due to increased support for the CCC, Mnangagwa will continue to use the army and police to suppress opposition members and maintain political control.

The Zimbabwe African National Union–Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) has been the majority party since Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, with former President Robert Mugabe serving until 2017 when Mnangagwa staged a coup d'etat and took power. However, the party hasn’t been able to keep control for so long without inflicting violence and threatening people at the polls.

According to a report by Aljazeera, in 1997, the government established a surveillance state and labeled dissenters as western stooges to take the blame off the ZANU-PF for incredible economic hardship during this time. The Zimbabwean dollar fell by 71.5 percent against the US dollar, and the stock market crashed by 46 percent on a day known as Black Friday.

Today, the people of Zimbabwe are no strangers to economic hardship and corruption. In December of 2022, inflation peaked at 280 percent, one of the highest rates globally, and 7.9 million people, half of the population, fell into extreme poverty between 2011 to 2022, according to an article by Aljazeera.

ZANU-PF has also not changed since it came to power, attempting to retain control by any means necessary with little care for the consequences. The country has never been a true democracy––it has existed as a semi-totalitarian regime since its independence.

Readers need to remember that the British and other European powers subjugated the continent of Africa for decades, stripping the people of their land and resources. The British left Zimbabwe in 1980, yet political infighting and increased tensions between the two rival political parties at the time remained due to British intervention, creating a less-than-perfect environment to create a new government. Zimbabwe started on the wrong foot and has had to contend with that disadvantage since.

For the past 40 years, the Zimbabwean government has attempted to fix these economic and political issues by maintaining incredible control in all sectors of life and restricting the people’s right to vote. Although this scheme may work in a perfect world, with rampant corruption and many economic factors from around the globe crippling the Zimbabwean economy, this form of government is obviously not working and has never worked. And that is why the CCC won 19 out of the 28 seats up for reelection in the last parliamentary election.

People are obviously unhappy and want change, and the CCC is an avenue for people to make a difference. However, as the CCC gains more power in parliament and the electorate, ZANU-PF and Mnangagwa will clamp down even harder on opposition to their policies. They will continue unjustly jailing and even killing people.

As more and more democracies fall, groups like the CCC that keep fighting even with 40 years of oppression by ZANU-PF become increasingly necessary. Zimbabwe is just one case of people fighting for their right to vote and the fundamental ideals of democracy. Many more people worldwide are also fighting for these rights—readers must not forget that fact.

Around the world right now, democracy is under attack. The U.S. capitol insurrection in 2021, the storming of the Brazilian capitol building in early January, Israel’s new far-right government attempting to weaken the judiciary branch, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are all examples of democracy eroding across the globe. The privilege of living in the United States often leaves citizens clueless about global events and the status of other nations. It is important as citizens of the globe to draw focus on life outside of the United States, especially in moments like these.
