The year is 350 BCE. There is a competition taking the intellectuals of ancient Greece by storm: philosophers and theologians alike are trying to define a human in as few words as they can. Plato has narrowed it down to just two words; when he does, he climbs the steps of the Athenian agora and delivers the fruits of his labor–featherless biped. The crowd then applauds the cleverness of the definition and goes about their days. But not Diogenes of Sinope. Perhaps Plato’s greatest contemporary hater, Diogenes takes it upon himself to pluck a wild chicken’s feathers and barge into one of Plato’s lectures with the creature in his hand, declaring: **"BEHOLD, A MAN"**

Spite? Probably. Plato ended up amending his definition to “featherless biped with long flat nails” after the fact. But Diogenes’ conflict with Plato and his teachings was more than the petty rivalry of philosophers and their contemporaries; Diogenes saw Plato’s ideals as fundamentally distasteful and contrary to both dignity and human autonomy. When Plato found Diogenes washing a head of cabbage in a stream, he taunted, “if you knew how to pay court to kings you wouldn’t have to wash vegetables.” To this Diogenes responded, “if you knew how to wash vegetables you wouldn’t have to pay court to kings.” Unlike Plato, who was reportedly enraged over the disobedience of a house-slave and barely able to stop himself from striking the offending slave, Diogenes remained completely unconcerned when a member of his staff ran away mid-transit. When advised to pursue the runaway slave, Diogenes replied, “It would be absurd, if Manes can live without Diogenes, but Diogenes cannot get on without Manes.”

**Remembering that Classical Ancient Greece was a highly stratified and unequal society for non-citizens, how do modern scholars studying Greece’s most impressive minds reconcile that fact?** Plato clearly was content with his position in life—even if we remember him along with Socrates and Aristotle as one of the greatest philosophers of the ancient world, we must also remember that Plato’s academy was an academic institute where all but the most educated and well-connected were barred from entry. Although his _Republic_ may espouse itself as a guide to a just city-state, Plato himself saw nothing wrong with subjugating slaves for his personal benefit. Diogenes, on the other hand, is a much more sympathetic figure in the eyes of the twenty-first century. Anti-establishment, disdainful of kings, sympathetic (or at least unpretentious) to his runaway slaves, the philosophy Diogenes preached—broadly considered classical cynicism—was grounded in minimalism and accessible to Athens’ lowest citizen. Diogenes himself slept in a barrel in the middle of the marketplace and made a virtue of his staggering poverty; he owned nothing but a bowl which he threw away in favor of cupping his hands to drink. Yet Diogenes, too, was content: the publicly-defecating, homeless, impoverished philosopher is recorded as telling Alexander the Great, the most powerful man in the 4th century, that if he were not Diogenes he would still wish to be Diogenes.

Ultimately, would a carving of a rude and hateful mid-lecture interjection be a poor fit for the walls of an academic institution? Probably, but Diogenes and the chicken stand for more than simple unruly disobedience. **That plucked chicken represented a challenge to the contrived and pretentious spiel that passed for wisdom in Diogenes’ day**, and nothing about it is attention-seeking or childish at all. Instead, the philosopher stood for his simple and unpretentious beliefs. That in and of itself makes Diogenes–and Cate Pittelli ‘20, the alum that framed this testament for Diogenes’ disdain for Platonic thought–worthy of contemplation and admiration.
