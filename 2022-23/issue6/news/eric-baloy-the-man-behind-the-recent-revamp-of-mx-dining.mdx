Think back to the last meal you cooked, whether for your friends, family, or self. It’s certainly no easy feat: finding an exciting recipe, properly following it, and cleaning up are all challenging tasks. Now imagine the difficulty of executing that work to feed anywhere between 200-500 people for three meals per day, every day of the school year. That is the incredible feat that the Middlesex FLIK team takes on. To understand the complexity of this task, take the process of creating one Friday lunch entree: fish cakes. Preparation begins immediately once fresh fish is delivered to the school at 4:30 p.m the night before; then, on Friday morning, the chefs will arrive early at 7:00 a.m. to begin cooking the fish. The cooking process is so complex and lengthy that the fish cakes come out of the oven just minutes before lunchtime begins. Moreover, fish cakes are only one entree served during lunch: while part of the kitchen staff works on the fish, others have to prepare all the other dishes, from vegetarian options to the nibbles line and the salad bar.

After the previous head chef mutually separated with Middlesex to pursue a new opportunity in his career, **the arduous task of feeding the entire Middlesex community, from students to faculty and their families, has been handed to new head chef Eric Baloy and sous-chef Julie Larocque.** 

Born and raised in Paris, France, Eric has worked as a chef since 1982––an extraordinary career of 41 years. He possesses a wealth of cooking experience, and has worked for numerous hotel chains, including the Ritz-Carlton, Le Méridien, and Four Seasons Hotels. **In France, Eric also worked in three Michelin Star restaurants, a highly prestigious distinction awarded to restaurants that is likened in importance to the annual Academy Awards for films.**

Despite Eric’s wealth of experience as a chef, the new job at Middlesex is his first time in charge of a school kitchen. Already, there have been noticeable and welcome changes in the dining experience, from unique dishes—including tuna poke bowls, braised haddock, and Jamaican jerk chicken—that have greatly increased the quality of the food. **Eric attributes much of this improvement to his amazing sous-chef Julie and the kitchen staff’s warm welcome**; notably, their openness to change has allowed Eric to implement his style of management in the kitchen. Eric keeps a closer eye on the cooks and runs the kitchen more rigidly than the previous head chef in an effort to push the kitchen to the next level of success. He recognizes that, by doing this, his team is “on the right path” as they strive to become the best version of themselves. With the current food quality, this statement rings true.

**For Eric, the greatest satisfaction of being a chef is the ability to make people happy**: to plan a special meal, work hard all day to make it happen, and have people tell him that the food was excellent—that is extraordinarily special to Eric. He has also found it interesting to create meal rotations that satisfy the diets of as many people as possible. That said, the average diet of a Middlesex student consists of a shocking amount of bagels, pizza, french fries, pasta, chicken wings, and ice cream. **In just one day alone, David Peterson, Middlesex’s Director of FLIK Food Services, estimates that Middlesex goes through over 200 bagels, 240 lbs of chicken wings, and sixty 16” inch pizzas each time they’re on the menu.**

Yet, while almost all aspects of working at MX have been enjoyable for Eric, there is one thing in particular that he would like to see us improve on as a school community. **The amount of waste that Middlesex goes through is incredible; for example, Peterson estimates that while the kitchen serves a whopping 140 pounds of meatballs for lunch, at least 30 pounds of whole, untouched meatballs remain on students’ plates and ultimately in the trash.** One can imagine how disheartening it is as a chef to spend hours preparing a dish, only to see almost a quarter of it thrown out virtually untouched. As a community, we can and must do better.

Eric’s arrival at Middlesex is an exciting change for the entire Middlesex community. As the quality of the dining hall meals only continues to improve, we must make sure to support some of the most hard-working and underappreciated members of our community.
