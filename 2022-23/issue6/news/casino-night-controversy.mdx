At the end of the first semester, exhausted from a final week of tests, projects, and quizzes, the Middlesex student body certainly deserves a celebration. For some, this may entail a week of wellness activities or a weekend spent watching playoff football, but for many, a triumphant transition into the second semester calls for a night of Blackjack, Texas hold 'em, and Roulette. Casino Night, also known as Cash Night, gives students the chance to experiment with all of these games and more. With the highly-anticipated event approaching, many students are looking forward to an evening of games with friends. However, in recent years, the true purpose of this night has been somewhat disputed. While the tradition remains loved by many, a growing number of community members worry that age and gender dynamics can create problematic scenarios among students.

It’s become clear that this controversy stems from the romantic aura of the event––it’s inevitably present in the punny signs, the chapel photos of the dapper dates, and the buzz leading up to the event. By creating the notion that these dates are always romantic, the concept of a senior asking a freshman may seem “a little strange,” Brenna Morrissey, Middlesex’s Director of Student Activities, points out. Yet several students express sentiments that any romantic aspects of the process were unintended. Ethan Ali ‘26 states that while these pairings are considered dates to the dance, it’s “not in a relationship way.” According to Morrissey, **“the true meaning of cash night is to meet a new person and not to think of the night as a real date,”** and is meant to provide upperclassmen with the chance to say, “this is our community, let me bring you along.” Thus, she is “not trying to shut down” a tradition that has largely provided students with fun experiences—she just wants to ensure that the event is run in such a way that no student feels “sought after.” Alex Barron ‘24 agrees that the true purpose of the event is for “upperclassmen and underclassmen to bond.”

In addition to romantic concerns, gender dynamics have also been a prevalent issue in recent years. Barron acknowledges that Cash Night has always been “somewhat heteronormative,” as the vast majority of dates are girl-boy. But acknowledging this pattern too stems from recognizing the potential romantic nature of the event. When one eliminates this notion of a completely romantic event, this seemingly questionable topic dissipates.

Ultimately, like Morrissey states, “only the students can change” this narrative: **if students find any aspect of the event to be problematic, we have the capacity and responsibility to act on it**. Faculty members are certainly open to student suggestions, and even held a community life meeting dedicated to Casino Night last year. Perhaps pairings could be randomly assigned as is done for Random Dance. Nevertheless, whether the current system of upperclassmen and underclassmen attending in pairs is maintained in years to come or not, it’s important to be conscientious of the feelings of others in this period of acquiring a date. After all, this event’s success is determined by the happiness of its participants.
