As of July 23, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared monkeypox a global health emergency, immediately alarming the public.

COVID-19, and now monkeypox. It seems as if we cannot catch a break from these infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, and research has now provided the world with invaluable information and technology to treat the virus. However, a monkeypox epidemic is an unfamiliar reality, and many misconceptions and speculations have already arisen. Therefore, it is best to start with concrete facts.

Monkeypox is a zoonosis, a virus that is transmitted between animals and humans, that shares similar symptoms with smallpox. It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus that infects humans and animals such as tree squirrels, dogs, dormice, and monkeys.

The symptoms primarily consist of rashes located on or near one’s genitals or other areas such as the face, hands, feet, and mouth, and may initially appear as mere blisters or pimples. Other symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, respiratory problems, and headaches. These symptoms often start within three weeks of exposure to the virus. Those with pre-existing skin conditions, such as eczema, have the highest risk of experiencing severe symptoms. In the event of lesions appearing in the sensitive parts of the body, specifically the eyes, the level of danger is much more extreme.

**Despite the sudden upsurge in media coverage, monkeypox is not a new virus**. The first human case of monkeypox was recorded in 1970 in Africa.

Europe is the center of this outbreak, with more than 80% of confirmed infections worldwide to date. In the United States, there are 9,500 reported cases across over 45 states. Men who have sexual intercourse with other men are one of the highest demographic groups to contract this virus. “Right now, about 98% of monkeypox cases are in queer and gay folks and our sexual networks. Of course, that includes trans and non binary folks,” Joseph Osmundson, a biologist at NYU, explains. Given these relatively one-sided statistics, many have begun to view monkeypox as a sexually transmitted disease. However, it is critical to remember that homosexuality does not cause or spread monkeypox, and it is not, as the media reports, “a gay disease.”

However, sexual contact is not the only way monkeypox can spread, as in rare occasions, one may catch monkeypox by touching contaminated surfaces or having face-to-face interactions with an infected person. Nevertheless, there’s no need to feel overwhelmingly anxious, as **the chances of catching monkeypox in public settings are highly unlikely**, with a miniscule 0.2% of people becoming infected via a contaminated surface. “You would have to brush against [another person’s skin], like a scrubbing brush, to then make an abrasion in your skin that monkeypox can enter,” infectious disease specialist Dr. Peter Chin-Hong explains.

So what exactly is the government doing about this problematic disease? Well, after two months of vaccine shortage, the Biden administration announced that they will use a different injection method that only uses one-fifth of the current dosage. In Denmark, Jynneos, the sole producer of the primary monkeypox vaccine, indicates that more than 200,000 doses that were thought to be expired may still be usable. With these new developments, the U.S. might have enough vaccines for hundreds of thousands more people at risk by the end of 2022.

With the experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems like the government has more confidence in this new plan of public health measures to prevent this current monkeypox emergency from becoming another catastrophic epidemic. While we currently do not know the extent of the damage monkeypox can inflict, the prevention of another 2020 COVID-19 roller coaster is the government’s main priority.
