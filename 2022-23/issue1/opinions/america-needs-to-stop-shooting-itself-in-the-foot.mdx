Fueled by the need for simple, yet marketable, stances, politicians have spun gun control debates into black-and-white “guns kill” versus “people kill” arguments. This oversimplification allows pro-gun politicians to criticize any attempt to regulate guns as an attack on an inanimate object. Thus, instead of promoting solutions, these politicians rally their voters to block the so-called Second Amendment infringements of gun reform.

Barnard professor and gun expert, Matthew Lacome, says that after “Democratic and Republican politicians start taking clear stances [,] people’s views tend to fall into line to match their partisan outlooks.” Thus, red flag laws, permit to carry laws, background checks, and mental health restrictions — all favored by the majority of both parties in polls — are blocked by Republican voters when introduced in ballots. **The polarization of gun views along party lines is dangerous because the “guns kill” and “people kill” stances ignore the complexity of the gun issue.**

Given the combination of of gun culture, overcrowding, and poverty, it makes no sense when many pro-gun advocates use Iceland’s huge gun ownership rate but low homicide rate to prove that gun regulation is unnecessary in the U.S. Nor does it make sense when gun reformers cite Australia, where citizens turned in 20% of privately owned guns via buybacks, causing homicide rates to drop exponentially, as an example that banning gun sales would work in the U.S. Gun violence is so deeply ingrained in American culture that we cannot expect a sudden gun decline or a sudden safe handling of guns.

Both guns and people kill. **And thus, to decrease gun violence, both pro-gun and anti-gun politicians need to work together to simultaneously target dangerous guns and gun possession.**

A complete ban of gun sales would not solve gun violence in the United States. There is already infrastructure in place that would allow under-the-radar gun exchanges. Plenty of guns are sold second hand via country fairs, friends, and online swaps. Such a high demand item will make its way around the United States despite bans, especially with an estimated over 380 million guns already in circulation. Banning all guns gives immense power to a $11 billion selling black market, with the ability to self-regulate. Motivated by money, these sellers would target unlisted, underage buyers with steeper prices. Without registration and increase of easily-produced and untraceable guns, black market consumers would be difficult to track.

However, bans on certain guns—dangerous weapons and accessories—would decrease violence. Many states recently restricted the transmission of untraceable ghost guns. Delaware Gov. John Carey recently signed a package of bills that aim to prohibit assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We need to ban weapons that solely aim to injure, but these laws alone will not be enough to make a difference on gun violence.

Since the majority of homicides and mass shootings are perpetrated with legally bought handguns, we need to also regulate gun possession itself. Studies show that combined licensing-and-background laws more effectively decrease gun violence. In 2020, a group of researchers studied laws in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Missouri and found consistent correlations between these laws and massive decreases in gun violence. Background checks will help mass shootings in particular, where 64.5% of perpetrators were found to have a prior criminal record and 62.8% with a history of violence.

Often, gun violence occurs with a sudden impulse. Waiting periods give time between purchase and physical possesion, and they have thus been found to decrease suicide and homicide rates. As a last resort, many states have also suggested anonymous Red Flag Laws that allow private data exchanges between concerned observers and police that seek to remove guns from unsafe hands.

Bipartisan gun reform will be an expensive, time-consuming task. Ultimately, though, it will save lives and chip away at cycles of violence, instability, and inequality.
