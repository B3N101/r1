By the end of 2022, according to _Screen Rant_, theaters around the United States will see twenty-two new sequels, a fact which represents a continuation of Hollywood's endless formula of regurgitating stale plot lines and an affirmation of the film industry's gradual loss of originality and creativity.

From 1999 to 2011, theaters brought audiences' imaginations to new limits. On March 31, 1999, when _The Matrix_ was first released, it was in the age of the internetâ€™s explosion. The movie struck a chord of fear and anxiety about the future of the online world, stepping precisely on the beat of the times with a new millennium approaching.

But 22 years later, in 2021, the concept of mixed reality and a digital universe was not unrealistic. _The Matrix_ is no longer a total fantasy. People have a new understanding of virtual and mixed reality in the rapidly developing modern era. **Although _The Matrix Resurrections_ holds attention like its predecessors, fatigue and technological evolution pervade the story's once splendidly outrageous plot.**

Unfortunately, the thought that another sequel ruined a glorious cinema masterpiece is not exclusive to the world of Neo and Morpheus. 

In actuality, it is only the tip of the iceberg. Hollywood blockbusters consistently ruin classics, and the reason is not as complicated as one might think.

Since studios have a pre-established cash cow story on their hands when they choose to create sequels, the wealth they can accumulate with minimal effort is easy to envision. Why take the risk of creating an entirely new story? After all, it is risky. The risk of a box office flop is much higher because there is no guaranteed audience base.

As audiences move into the new decade, financial pressure from streaming services and other factors has made the Big Six-- 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, Columbia Pictures, Universal Pictures & Walt Disney Pictures-- and their movie strategies even more conservative. 

Hollywood seems to now prefer to give the "green light" to sequels that cost $150 million or more to produce and acquire $600 million at the worldwide box office to recover their costs, rather than spend tens of millions of dollars on an original movie with no assured success. As a product full of uncertainty, capital is desperate to find certainty in it, and the Hollywood assembly line of IP has proved the success of this method.

Nevertheless, money talks. 

Sequels have long been a part of the Hollywood film industry. The success of new and original films may become even rarer. But the decline in the quality of Hollywood sequels is at least a sign of the deterioration of the original sequel model. The fatigue of audiences brought on by excessive sequel mania will eventually evoke change. 

**Under such circumstances, Hollywood should ponder their approach to better quality sequels: a balance between profitability and creativity.** Hollywood should allow writers the freedom to fabricate new ideas while making sure they operate within an overall structure that continues the strong culture of older films. Few studios can keep this balancing act forever, especially since the recipe changes over time. Suppose a movie can't express its inner self well. In that case, it cannot create similar buzz and interest among audiences as it did before.

The controversy over the sequel will likely never stop. The decision between creating an entirely new story or expanding on the foundations of another will never be as simple as choosing between the red pill or the blue pill.
