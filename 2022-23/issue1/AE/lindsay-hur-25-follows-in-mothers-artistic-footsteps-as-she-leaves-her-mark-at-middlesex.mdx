Flip through the latest issue of the _Anvil_ or the _Iris_, or take a look at the walls throughout the second floor of BAP. Throughout each display, a prominent recurring name will appear—Lindsay Hur.

As an established artist at Middlesex, Hur previously chose to use her sixth academic block to enroll in the drawing elective. Hoping to gain access to the art studio after the school day, Hur has decided to enroll in the painting class this fall semester. Hur says that her passion for art is less about entertaining others and more about providing a therapeutic outlet for herself expressing “the things I can’t explain in words,” as she puts it.

**Hur’s biggest artistic influence is her mom, who helped her learn to draw and paint when she was a young child.** Acting as a source of guidance and inspiration, Hur’s mother, an artist as well, continues to help Hur whenever she struggles to begin a project or develop an idea.

Hur adds, “She’s my role model in life. I just want to become just like her.”

Years since she first began to learn, Hur believes her artistic style has become more realistic; even if her subject does not seem real or realistic, it symbolizes something in her reality.

Despite her evolved art style, Hur finds that many of her works trace back to her mother, citing, “I would draw a mother and a kid. Or, I can draw a wedding ring that symbolizes her marriage.”

Often, Hur prefers colored pencils and markers over paints because they give her more control and allow her to express herself better within her art. However, Hur’s favorite piece she has created thus far is a painting.

“It’s a waiter holding a bunch of stacked plates. It’s a huge painting, pretty big compared to what I’ve created before, and it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. It took me three months, the whole summer. And **I remember I was crying and saying, ‘What am I doing, like I do not want to do this,’ but then I ended up finishing it**. So I felt so accomplished afterwards,” Hur recalls.

Hur says the painting was directed toward herself, as the precariously balanced stack of plates symbolizes the importance of smart decision-making and its impact on the rest of one’s life.

“Like a waiter holding that [stack], it’s a skill that you need to learn… Dropping one [plate] would cause the whole thing to drop. You need to be careful… if you make one decision, you need to be responsible with the results [and] consequences,” she reflects.

Looking ahead, Hur’s biggest motivation at the moment for her art is getting into the art school her mom attended. Hur says that since she does not see herself as particularly academically or athletically talented; the only thing she feels confident in is her art, an assurance that powerfully drives her, as she believes she was born to create.

“I grew up in a family where college is a very important thing in life, so… I have to trust and rely on my art skills.”

Lindsay hopes that through her art, she is able to reach and explain things to “those people who feel understanding by seeing.” Most importantly, Lindsay advises others to “just do what you want. There are so many ways to express yourself, especially in art… You can honestly draw a dot on the picture, and it can be a huge symbol of something to [someone].”

Although an artist is often represented as a signature at the bottom of their works, the finished pieces displayed to the public come from a unique combination of the artist’s background, inspiration, and dedication. Lindsay Hur’s distinct upbringing into the arts continues to define her artistic development as she refines her skills and explores new ideas.
