Inspired by Rachel Solomon’s ’23 awesome experiences in Wilderness Adventures’ Southeast Alaska program last summer, Sophia Fawcett decided to sign up for the program this summer. Ready to make her own memories, Sophia flew to Juneau, Alaska on June 18th, and didn’t return to her home in Massachusetts until July 8th. 

**From spotting humpback whales while kayaking to hiking amidst Alaska’s breathtaking fauna, Sophia found plenty to love about her time in the wilderness.** While many members of the Middlesex community spent the Fourth of July at parades, family functions, or by the beach, Sophia spent the day climbing the inside of Flower Mountain’s glacier, located near Haines, Alaska. 

While Fawcett’s Wilderness Adventures’ Alaska trip was an awe-inspiring experience, no journey comes without its challenges. Many parts of the expedition were both mentally and physically exhausting. Hiking through treacherous terrain for 21 days with minimal rest proved to be the ultimate fitness test. Between backpacking, ice climbing, mountaineering, kayaking, and whitewater rafting, **the raw Alaskan elements presented a sizable physical challenge for Fawcett,** and total isolation from her friends and family for a sustained period of time left her emotionally drained. Fawcett recalls that Saturday afternoons usually spent relaxing in the sun, catching up with childhood friends, and going on family drives were replaced instead with nights spent camping in daunting Alaskan forests. Fawcett was isolated not only from her family, but also from technology and social media—a shocking adjustment for anyone living in the 21st century when people and digital devices seem inseparable.

Nevertheless, spending 21 days with a small group of nuanced individuals allowed Fawcett to form friendships rapidly over shared experiences. The program attracts travel enthusiasts from across the country, making for an extremely diverse and engaging travel group. **The program allowed Fawcett to connect with intriguing individuals with whom she otherwise would never have crossed paths**, like a nationally ranked wake surfer originally from Russia. Fawcett’s memorable journey to Alaska is an experience she would recommend to any members of the Middlesex community who love outdoor activities and the thrill of off-the-grid exploration. The victorious feeling of reaching the top of a nine mile summit on the hottest day of a month-long expedition is unforgettable, as Fawcett described it, and thus, despite the exhaustion, Fawcett was gloomy as the time came to depart from the beautiful state and return home.
