It’s easy to fall for the deceiving uniformity of the Middlesex experience. Although all students encounter the same prerequisite art courses, AP English classes, and moments on the circle, every student approaches them with a distinct story. Myroslav Bur ‘24 hails from Krolevets, Ukraine, and carries with him a deeply inspirational perspective.

Myroslav has a multitude of passions, including travel, environmentalism, and volunteer work. In Ukraine, he co-founded a service organization that safely disposes of batteries. **Without a doubt, he is a nuanced, valuable addition to the Middlesex community,** and he has faced many obstacles to become a part of it.

Myroslav was at a scientific competition in Kyiv to present his research in agronomy from February 21-26, 2022. He recalls that on February 23, one of his friends, at school in his hometown at the time, wished that he wouldn’t have to go to class the next day to take a math test. The friend never imagined that he would wind up not having to take the test after all.

Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, leaving Myroslav and his friends stranded at the competition in Kyiv. “At that time, we didn’t know what was happening… there were no news updates because the TV towers were bombed and all communication was shut down,” Myroslav said, remembering the initial wave of chaos and confusion. Around 6 or 7 AM, he and his friends scrambled to get a few days’ worth of food at a nearby grocery store. “We could hear explosions and air raid sirens… we saw a lot of helicopters,” he recalled. He then managed to find a bomb shelter, where he spent two days underground with his friends before hearing news of trains traveling to western Ukraine, a slightly safer area.

“I had only 10 minutes to decide,” he recalls. 10 minutes to choose whether or not to leave his family and home behind. **“We didn’t even know what train we were taking… We didn't know anything. We just wanted to get out of Kyiv.”** Getting on the train, however, brought little relief: “we were going without lights on because Russians would shoot the train… people were sleeping in corridors and toilets.” After arriving in western Ukraine and waiting outside for about 15 hours, he and friends managed to cross the border into Slovakia, where he lived for 90 days on a tourist visa.

On March 11, 2022, while living in Slovakia, Myroslav received his acceptance email from Middlesex. He had applied to Middlesex in January through Ukraine Global Scholars, a non-profit organization that helps talented Ukrainian students gain scholarships to boarding schools and colleges around the globe, after which time they return to Ukraine for five years to help rebuild the country. Although Myroslav remembers the joy of receiving his acceptance, in general he felt “very shocked… there was simply a gap between being in Kyiv and coming to America.”

In May 2022, Myroslav traveled to the US for the first time and stayed in Concord for three days. Before traveling to Slovakia, he had been out of Ukraine only twice to visit Egypt. “It was crazy, but it wasn’t hard,” he noted, when describing the adjustment to life in the US. **For the first time in months, he was able to see daily life uninterrupted by war, and was even able to attend a Middlesex Freedom of Speech event**. “I met so many talented zebras,” he said, with admirable school spirit.

This summer, Myroslav traveled to Cushing Academy to take summer classes. “It was my first time being immersed in an English environment,” he said, an undoubtedly daunting experience. “Ukraine’s school system differs significantly from the American one… most of the kids stay at the same school for all 11 years of their educational journey; secondly, we usually take 15-17 classes every semester, with health studies, law, and military science among some of the special ones,” he noted. Despite the challenging adjustment, his agreeable optimism and impressive intelligence allowed him to thrive. “I really like participating,” he said. Middlesex students will benefit greatly from Myroslav’s insights and contributions in the classroom.

With regard to this school year, Myroslav hopes to build on his existing knowledge of environmental science so that he can “contribute to saving the environment back home.” He also looks forward to fully experiencing MX outside of the classroom. “I would be very happy to make friends with everyone on campus and find someone who could show me some good trails in the woods,” he said. In the end, he reports: **“I think that the most exciting thing is that I will meet a lot of folks from all over the world.** I love to discover about other countries and their traditions and cultures.” There is no doubt that Middlesex’s resources can help his ambitions come to life. Welcome, Myroslav!
