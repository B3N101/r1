The 2022-23 NFL season is underway, meaning Fantasy Football is back and in full swing. With unexpected emerging talents and disappointing performances already aplenty, here is a look at three takeaways following Week 2 of the NFL season:

**Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle can effectively coexist in Miami** with the Dolphins as WR1s, and Tua is a trustworthy QB1! With Tyreek Hill’s arrival from Kansas City this offseason, many doubted whether the Miami offense captained by a young quarterback would be able to support both Hill and budding second year receiver, Jaylen Waddle. Those doubts have already proven to be wrong as both Hill and Waddle saw 11 targets each, easily surpassed 100+ receiving yards (190 for Hill and 171 for Waddle), and scored two touchdowns each in Week 2 versus a powerful Baltimore Ravens defense. They also played in over 50 snaps each, holding active positions in the offense. This newly formed, dynamic passing attack has benefited greatly from the arrival of superstar Hill, and has substantially aided Tua’s development as a third year quarterback who has already made a big leap this season as an effective passer. The Dolphins have started off at a comfortable 3-0, looking to extend their hot streak as the season progresses, while steamrolling with Waddle and Hill’s fiery production.

**Darnell Mooney and the Chicago Bears' passing game are not to be trusted.** With Justin Fields at the reins of this offense, Chicago operates in a run-heavy style of play, often integrating running back sets and designing plays around Fields’ rushing ability. Wide receiver Darnell Mooney and tight end Cole Kmet, two players seemingly primed for breakout years in the pre-season, now lie astray in an offense that has provided essentially no opportunity for them. In Week 2’s matchup against the Packers, Fields only had 11 passing attempts, totaling a mere 70 yards and an interception. On just two targets in that game, Mooney totaled one reception for an incredible four-yard loss. Yes, negative four yards, totaling to a whopping 0.6 fantasy football points. Through two games this season, Kmet was targeted only once in each affair, failing to record a reception in either of the two. Mooney and Kmet now sit quietly at just seven combined targets in two games. Running back David Montgomery is the only player on the roster with more than three catches. Now leading into Week 3, Fields has only totaled a substandard 191 passing yards. The Bears have the fewest passing yards in the NFL by far, as well as the fewest passes (28), the second-worst passer rating (69.2), and the lowest completion percentage (53.6). The failures of this offense also fall in the hands of first year head coach, Matt Eberflus, who is still evidently figuring out how to work with this messy offense. The Bears’ rest-of-season schedule figures to ease up slightly, but Fields’ run-first and zero-pass mentality, as well as Eberflus’ woes as a coordinator, erase any Bears' pass catchers from fantasy relevancy.

**Carson Wentz and the Washington Commanders are legit.** Washington has relied heavily on the passing game, particularly with their three top wide receivers: Terry McLaurin, Jahan Dotson, and Curtis Samuel. All three ran for a stellar 46 routes out of a possible 53 total pass plays. McLaurin, Dotson, and Samuel all caught at least four passes for over 50 yards, with two of the three receivers catching touchdowns. Wentz and this offense are truly clicking, ensuring all of these receivers to be in the conversation as weekly fantasy starters.

Albeit relatively early into the season, these three takeaways may show a glimpse of what is to come for the duration, whether that be a flustered Bears offense or an explosive Dolphins passing attack. The many weeks remaining in this already thrilling 2022-23 NFL season will only unveil more surprises.
