CONCORD, Massachusetts—The Middlesex Football team is not a winning team. Since 2010, the Middlesex Zebras Football team has a record of 36-53-2. With a winning percentage of 39.56% since 2010, the Detroit Lions and New York Giants both outperformed the Zebras. Despite Coach Lang and his staff’s tireless efforts, since 2004, the team only reached the playoffs one time. Most recently, the 2019 Zebras claimed the Mark Conroy Bowl over Canterbury School.

After the retirement of Coach Lang in 2021, the Zebras sought to find a suitable replacement for the long-time cornerstone of the football program and symbol of Middlesex sports—enter Coach Amal Scott. A part of the Zebras’ football program since 2016, Coach Scott is no stranger to the hunger the team has to get back to the playoffs.

**After the Zebras’ joint practice with Belmont Hill, Coach Scott said, “This means everything to me. The ability to stay here and coach these young guys is the opportunity I’ve been waiting for all this time.”**

However, stepping into this new role, Coach Scott is aware that “leadership is one of the most important parts of this job.” And, in response to an entirely new coaching staff this year for the Zebras, Coach Scott said, “I have to make sure I’m building their careers as well as I’m building these players’ careers.”

One such young career is that of junior quarterback Ty Fein ’24. Fein was hesitant to name himself the starting quarterback, stating, “As a team, we haven’t stated a starting quarterback quite yet. We are waiting till the first game to state a starting quarterback.”

Fein commented on Coach Scott’s immediate impact on the team: “Coach Scott has brought so much energy into this system…people are really excited to keep playing.”

“I love Coach. As someone who is finally getting a chance to play, he is making me feel confident,” added junior running back Malcolm Clark ’25.

The transition into the head coaching position is no easy task. This position involves both management and leadership. However, Coach Scott seems to have stepped into the role with ease. Senior lineman Gabe Custodio Guzman ’23 commented, “Coach Scott is a leader that leads by example…Coach Lang was a great coach, but Coach [Scott] is a way more hands-on coach.”

Fein agreed. “Coach is very hands-on. He knows when to turn it on and turn it off…But then, at the end of practice, he knows when to slow it down, calm you guys down, and understands when people are confused and people need guidance and does a really good job at doing that.”

After falling just short of the playoffs last year, the Zebras look to make their way back to a bowl game. With a star-studded roster and the leadership of Coach Scott at the helm, there is no reason for the Zebras not to reclaim control of the ISL.

**With a new season ahead of the team and Coach Scott, Fein looks ahead with excitement, emphasizing, “I’m just really excited to see what he does.”**

The _Anvil_ will continue to follow the Zebras in their first year under Coach Scott and their road back to a championship season.
