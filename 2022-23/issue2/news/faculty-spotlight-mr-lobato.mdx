Have you ever met someone who is a polyglot, a volleyball expert, _and_ an exceptional musician? In fact, this seemingly superhuman individual is right here on Middlesex’s campus! Meet Mr. Lobato, a new Middlesex faculty member. 

Mr. Lobato is a new music teacher, leading the jazz band, chapel chorus, and SWAG. He is also the new assistant coach for Girls’ Varsity Volleyball and the faculty advisor for the International Student Association. And, as promised above, **he does, in fact, speak four languages fluently: English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian.**

Mr. Lobato was born in Brazil and lived there until he was 19 years old. His mother, whose first language was English, has lived in numerous countries. His stepfather is from Argentina and only speaks Spanish. However, the primary language in Brazil is Portuguese; hence, Mr. Lobato developed extraordinary trilingual abilities from a young age! Until he learned to read and write, the young Mr. Lobato thought Portuguese, English, and Spanish were one language.

Mr. Lobato came to the US to attend the Berklee College of Music in Boston and has an undergraduate degree in music education. While studying in the US, he shared a three-bedroom apartment with seven Italian roommates who barely spoke any English. Thus, Mr. Lobato embarked on the journey to becoming fluent in a fourth language. Mr. Lobato feels “lucky to make friends from all over the world and have been to different places." He has traveled to Japan and learned some Japanese; he stayed in Taiwan for a summer and learned Mandarin with both the Taiwanese and the Beijingese accents; he has been to Israel and learned a little bit of Hebrew, and he has had some close French-speaking friends. Mr. Lobato has thrived when he’s been immersed in environments with new languages and cultures.

Besides languages, music plays an integral part in Mr. Lobato's life. Mr. Lobato was born a music prodigy—he joined his middle school’s band and was a terrible player. However, he was passionate about music and hugely self-driven, seeking out lessons and knowledge despite not being  lucky enough to meet a “virtuoso” for guidance. As Mr. Lobato grew older and was influenced by his mother, who was a teacher, he perceived that “teachers should motivate their students to be better musicians and enjoy the things they love.” Hence, Mr. Lobato decided to be that motivator for other people. **“Everybody can enjoy music, make it play a great role in their lives, no matter how good or how old when taking their first step,” he said.** Mr. Lobato remained determined in his pursuit of the bass, and after high school, he received scholarships to attend Berklee.

Not only is Mr. Lobato an accomplished musician himself, but he devotes his life to “making sure everyone can enjoy music and learn about all different cultures by breaking down the barriers through music.” He earned his master's degree in music education, taught in public schools, and now joins the Middlesex community. He chose Middlesex because of its diversity and well roundedness. 

**Mr. Lobato loves that all students at Middlesex are encouraged to partake in sports, arts, and academics—creating more well-rounded individuals.** For him, specifically, the multilayered Middlesex experience has allowed him to pick up his volleyball skills. Before moving to Boston for college, he was a varsity volleyball player at the American School of Brasilia in Brazil. He played right-side (opposite) hitter. Coach Lobato is grateful that he is able to reignite his passion for volleyball at Middlesex. He also loves experiencing first-hand the varied passions of his students. He sees musicians thriving in his classroom and demonstrating great sportsmanship simultaneously. “One thing that makes Middlesex so wonderful is that we are all part of the community in very different ways,” he notes. 

Mr. Lobato is always open to everyone and loves learning more about students’ stories. Don’t be afraid to pay a visit to Mr. Lobato in his classroom in the RCC!
