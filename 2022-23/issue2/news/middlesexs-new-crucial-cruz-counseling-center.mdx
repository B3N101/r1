In early September, as it always does, Middlesex opened its doors to new students and faculty. Yet these new community members were not the only ones transitioning to a new environment; over the summer, Middlesex’s counseling department relocated from the department’s modest headquarters in the basement of Eliot Hall to the basement of Ware Hall, formerly known as the Cruz Health Center.

There are three counselors available on campus: Sarah Cohane, the Director of Counseling, as well as Mendy Jean and Kristyn Willis. Although the counseling department is separate from the Wellness Center (which treats physical illness and is found behind Atkins), mental and physical health are absolutely interconnected, and the fact that the basement of Ware has now been used for both dimensions of healthcare appears quite symbolic.

Speaking to the benefits of the new space, Cohane points to its size, as the multiplicity of rooms available now allows her and the other school counselors to work under the same roof, rather than scattered around campus as in previous years. **Cohane believes that this dynamic truly “builds cohesion for [the department]” and makes it “easier to coordinate” all that the department has going on each day.** The department also now has a conference room—an ideal, private space where support groups can meet. Harkening back to last year, Cohane describes the difficulty she and Willis faced when trying to organize a support group for injured athletes, stating that “it was really hard to find a space” and that it often felt like the group had to choose between space and privacy for each meeting.

As someone who puts in extensive effort to foster connections with and among students—through the Connections program, the Choices program, dorm duty, or a simple greeting in the hallway—**Cohane believes that it is critical for her and the counseling department to be visible and known entities on campus.** She believes that having meetings, support groups, and program administration all under one roof will not only allow the team to have easier access to students and a better pulse on the mental state of the community, but will also, in turn, allow students to be more familiar with Middlesex’s counseling resources and feel more comfortable approaching a counselor for guidance.

However, the counseling department still has a great deal of work to do in order to truly take advantage of its propitious new location. The admittedly “bland” and hospital-like feel of the basement will need to be fully expunged in order to create meeting spaces most conducive to therapeutic and educational work. This is where **students have a unique and crucial opportunity to help remake the space**—Cohane intends to rely on the input from mental health club heads and Wellness Ambassadors, but the opportunity to provide input extends to any student, no matter the grade level or familiarity with the space.

Overall, the new space contributes to the destigmatization of mental health on campus. The two mental health-related clubs on campus, Peace of Mind and Bring Change to Mind, are student-led groups that work towards this same goal. Cohane hopes that, as more clubs and students learn to utilize the counseling center, “we as a community can lean into our humanity” and learn that there is truly no need for the “pressure to put on a front”—we are all imperfect, and it is essential that students feel safe expressing emotional vulnerabilities at Middlesex, their home.
