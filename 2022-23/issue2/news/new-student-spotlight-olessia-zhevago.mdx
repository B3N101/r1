Olessia, a new junior at Middlesex, is very excited about the upcoming school year and hopes to have an enjoyable next two years of study. **Unlike a lot of high schoolers, however, Olessia chose to come to Middlesex because she actually wants to study more.** Although she is originally from Ukraine, Olessia was attending a boarding school in London before coming to Middlesex. In the British learning system, students can only choose four A-level subjects to study. This restriction posed a challenge for Olessia, as she was too passionate to only choose four subjects. As a result, she decided to make the journey to the US, where she can study a larger variety of topics in greater depth. 

Outside of the classroom, Olessia is extremely interested in wildlife. **Over the past few years, her passion for nature has grown, specifically for big cats and the Sahara desert**. She also loves knitting; it provides her with a productive way to destress and is a relaxing, creative outlet.

Keeping in mind that she had to travel across continents, Olessia’s journey to Middlesex was relatively smooth. The most difficult thing about her journey was the jet lag she experienced between London and Boston, as the fatigue made her feel dizzy and tired during her first few days on campus on top of the tiredness she felt from the already overwhelming orientation process. Luckily, after a few days, she was able to overcome the jet lag and was ready to fully delve into her Middlesex experience. 

**Olessia is looking forward to lots of things at Middlesex: from the academic rigor of junior year to the cross country season, programming club, and poetry club, Olessia is set to thrive in Middlesex’s immersive environment.** She is already buying into the MX experience by taking challenging courses like AP Chemistry and competing in cross country races. Welcome, Olessia!
