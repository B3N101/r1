There is something satisfying about finding a truly enjoyable album of music that not many people have heard. As someone who loves this liberating feeling, **this column is designed with a mission to highlight relatively unknown albums in the Middlesex Community** that are perfect, or at least close to it. It is important to note that the album mentioned in this issue has some explicit language and content that may not appeal to all listeners.

Keeping that in mind, _Unlocked_ by Denzel Curry and Kenny Beats is Issue #2’s album. This first collaboration between one of hip-hop’s most creative producers, Kenny Beats, and one of the genre’s hardest-hitting lyricists, Denzel Curry, is a tightly packaged 18-minute listen with some of the most interesting electronic production on any hip-hop album out there. 

Beats creates a sound that makes the listener feel as though they are living inside a post-apocalyptic video game with a soundtrack playing through the grainy speakers of an MP3 player. Beats’s use of sampling is mind blowing––he uses clips from a 1950s short film called _Age of Turmoil_ to help build up the futuristic vibe of the album on the opener “Track 01” and also pulls a sample from Chuck Bernard’s 1970s song titled “Everything is Alright Now” to use as background music at the end of “Track07.” 

While Beats’s uniquely intense production causes the listener to find themself banging their head to the throbbing bass, Curry’s rapid-fire bars and angry voice inflections add perfectly to the electric atmosphere of the album. Curry uses hilariously outrageous yet hard-hitting lyrics that sound like they are coming out of a B-15 bomber to entice the listener into seeing his journey through victorious eyes.** **

**The entire album feels like a victory lap for Curry, whose lyrics somehow tastefully reflect his arrogant spirit while maintaining a level of self-awareness that makes the intentionally ridiculous bars have meaning instead of feeling like filler.** The closing track on the album titled “‘Cosmic’ .m4a” has the most mainstream and atmospheric production on the album. Throughout the track, Beats’s production allows the listener to float into the cosmos while Curry tries to drag the listener back down to Earth with his bars about the harsh reality of life.

Eventually, towards the end of the song, Curry lets the beat ride, thus creating a climactic effect that wraps up the album on an existential note. It is hard to describe the impact of this album accurately because it is unlike any other hip-hop album ever created. Ultimately, this album is a flawless example of how the ingenuity and flexibility of hip-hop allow artists like Denzel Curry and Kenny Beats to create sensational listening experiences that people use as benchmarks for musical perfection.
