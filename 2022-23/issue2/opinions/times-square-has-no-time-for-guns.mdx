The upsurge of gun violence in the United States ignited chaos throughout the nation, and subsequently, governments and those in positions of power scrambled to compose solutions in an attempt to reconcile these problems.

In early September, Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul signed legislation restricting the possession of firearms. This legislation forbade firearm possession, public or concealed, in the district of Times Square, one of the busiest tourist centers in the world, among other public places. The law also declared schools, courts, mass transit, parks, and other establishments where alcohol is served as gun-free zones.

This ruling isn’t spontaneous. Rather, it is New York’s response to the Supreme Court ruling that advocated for the right of Americans to carry guns and targeted a 1913 New York law that restricted carrying firearms last June.   

The mayor unveiled a “Times Square: Gun Free Zone” sign in Times Square on Thursday, September 6th. The numerous signs are parts of an information campaign to aid both New Yorkers and tourists in understanding the new law, specifically stating gun-carriers are prohibited to enter unless they are authorized by law.

The legislation requires those with concealed-carry permits to adhere to the new eligibility requirements and finish a state-regulated gun training course. More specifically, since September 1, anyone who applies for a carry permit is required to have an in-person interview with the NYPD, complete 16 hours of training, provide the NYPD with four character references, as well as turn over every social media handle they’ve used in the past three years to the NYPD’s licensing division. 

**These mandates are relatively new, and naturally, multiple debates and opposing views have arisen.**

So what exactly are the views of the public? Kerri Clegg, a 48-year-old cake artist from London visiting NYC with her daughter for her 18th birthday, stated that the gun ban “makes me feel a little bit better, it has to be said, because we know that they’ve been problems before.” Clegg also stated that centers such as Times Square can be “big targets”, as it is a “very crowded, very touristy place.” On the other hand, Quinn Abbey, a 24-year-old accounting student from Georgia, claims that the new advisories haven't made her feel any safer. “I would assume, like anything in America, they say it’s a ‘gun-free zone’ but everyone still kind of has guns,” she says, adding, “I feel the same no matter where I go. I feel like you kind of have to fear for your life regardless of where you are, so it’s kind of scary.” When asked about her opinion on the gun-free zone advertisements, New Yorker Loren Parkins said, “Good luck enforcing it, but it’s great.” 

Given the numerous incidents involving gun violence that have consumed the entire nation, it seems as though the opinions from all sides are understandable. The fact that New York government officials are finally making concrete changes creates the possibility of a safer New York. However, there are others who, justifiably, have little faith both citizens and officials alike to create such a utopian reality. Nevertheless, the legislation has only been signed and put into effect a mere few weeks ago, and it is far too soon for one to come to an exact conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the mandate. Rather than sitting back and waiting to assess the success of this new rule, one can always act upon their own agency to invoke change and make this world a safer place.
