As Middlesex students returned to the normality of in-person learning, their long-standing problem with the rigid dress code also returned. Many students have protested the dress code in the past, arguing that it restricts comfort and individuality and prioritizes students’ clothing over their education, and the petitions finally led to an end to the Middlesex dress code at the beginning of this year.

In past years, the Middlesex dress code banned all sportswear, loungewear, tears and holes in clothing below the knees, large logos or brand names, and strapless or with straps thinner than the width of two fingers. Blue jeans were also banned until two years ago.

Schools often enforce dress codes to create a “professional” learning environment with no distractions, as well as to reduce possible social pressures and conflicts based on appearances. However, they can have a number of unintentionally negative effects on students’ education.

A main dissent against dress codes is that they often discriminate against girls and racial or sexual minorities. In many cases, there are specific policies targeting female clothing based on whether or not they seem “suggestive,” which often send out a strong and potentially harmful message to female students that their clothing or bodies are responsible for affecting the learning of other peers. This message only contributes to the idea that the way a student dresses is the way that they should be perceived or treated by others, when in reality, all students are responsible for their own learning regardless of other students’ appearances.

In other cases, dress codes can even reinforce sexual or racial intolerance by descriminating against hairstyles, accessories, or garments specific to a certain identity.

Although proponents of dress code argue that it promotes the health and decorum of students, the removal of the Middlesex dress code does not negatively impact any of these aspects. For instance, science labs and plaque classes require students to wear closed-toed shoes, as well as other protective gear like lab coats and safety glasses to keep students safe. Additionally, formal events like the annual Holiday concert or family weekend dinners still require traditional formal attire, allowing students to present themselves in proper and appropriate clothing when necessary.

In other words, dress codes can be, and often are, unfairly mandated. Not only do they often discriminate against specific identities, they prevent the freedom of expression for all students, which can take away from one's identity and individuality.

By allowing students to dress the way they want, students can dress in a way that gives themselves confidence, creating a school-wide environment that is more comfortable and accepting with one another. Moreover, students no longer have to take the additional step to buy clothing just for “class wear” or worry about the risk of being dress coded.

Thus, by abolishing the dress code, Middlesex places emphasis on students’ education rather than a trivial thing such as what its students are wearing, creating a more comfortable and expressive community where students can feel confident as they learn.
