Higher education is the gateway for many to move up the social ladder. According to the United States Census Bureau, there are nearly 40 million people in poverty across the country, and that number is steadily rising—about a quarter of them do not have high school diplomas.

In face of this further stratification of American society, Democrats proposed an expansion of the Pell Grant, a $20,000-monetary aid grant for college education from the federal government to students in low-income families. The White House outlined several promises of this new student-debt relief program, including reaching a broader borrowing population (projected to be 43 million); better targeting individuals in need; and eliminating age, racial, and gender discrimination. **However, despite benign intentions, the new program raises a few concerns.**

Ongoing monthly payments under the new program will affect the balances of borrowers. This income-driven aspect expects graduates to find paid, stable employment immediately after they graduate. The reality, however, is disappointing: current employment rates for recent college graduates are at a record-low of 51 percent, making this expectation seem like an impossibility.

Eligibility for the program should largely be based on financial aid, not so much on the student or their family’s ability to repay. Exclusion of individuals who have limited disposable income to repay loans dispels the government’s promises by ostracizing the lower class of American society. **Student loans are financial resources that encourage achievements among the young generation, not rejection letters that bar them from opportunities to lead a better life.**

The Biden-Harris administration has to deal with both intra-party and inter-party conflicts. Disagreements among Democratic moderates and progressives delayed the agenda to put forth a well-rounded plan, making any progress incremental at best. Tim Ryan, the Democrat representative of Ohio, publicly denounced the student loan forgiveness program, claiming that it prioritizes the rich instead of the poor and sends a wrong message to people in need.

In addition to rifts within the Democratic party, heightened conflict between the Democrats and Republicans will likely give rise to legal and political challenges from the right wing. The Senate has witnessed the Republican proposal of the _Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions Act_, desiring to limit and eventually remove the president’s power to cancel student loans. Other Republicans are looking to bring the issue to court, claiming that Biden is not entitled by the HEROES Act (Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act) of 2003 to debt cancellation, given that unemployment and economic inequality are not “national emergencies.”

While Biden’s plan to cancel student loans is an advancement in the efforts against inequality, **it is unlikely that Democrats will witness significant progress in the near future and it is uncertain whether the plan can even be carried out smoothly to reach its end goal.** After all, good things do not come easily, especially for something as impactful as this one.
