Frederick Winsor founded Middlesex in 1901 with an emphasis on the school’s nonsectarian status. Unlike many of its peers, Middlesex does not feature “St” in its name, nor does it feature a cross in its logo. Yet, Middlesex is inherently a Christian school. 

Aspects of Middlesex culture place less emphasis on non-Christian faiths. The “how-was-your-Christmas?'' comments and assumed knowledge of Christianity are insensitive, blatant displays that the majority of students at MX are Christian. 

That being said, Middlesex _can_ create a more inclusive culture by making campus a place where all faiths feel welcome. Many long-standing campus traditions began when Middlesex was almost all Christian Massachusetts boys. Today, numerous students explain that these traditions neglect their faith and make them feel uncomfortable. **With an increasing number of students who identify with different faiths or atheism on campus, these Christian-heavy traditions should be re-examined.**

Personally, as a Jewish Atheist, I feel strange singing hymns about Jesus and Saints every week in the chapel. And I feel uncomfortable being forced to listen to Christmas songs for two hours straight every year at the Holiday Concert. Yet, as a Jew, I am represented on campus. For less represented groups like Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus, Middlesex doesn't even acknowledge them.

We evidently have some work to do as a school. **And this work should _truly_ honor our cited care of diversity; we should not look for a quick performative, easy fix that allows us to label the school “inclusive.”** Last year, in an attempt to remedy the complaints about the Holiday Concert, Small Chorus included a Jewish song in their lineup. Although I appreciate the inclusive song choice, observing a group of Christians students on stage singing a random silly Hanukkah song felt embarrassing and ingenuine, especially after the plethora of beautiful, harmonized Christian songs. **It is really important that communication with group members proceeds these demonstrations so that students feel properly represented. As the school looks to update the hymn book and host their annual celebrations, we need to include more voices in the decision making process.**
