As a proud American, I find the very notion of a monarch both outrageous and antithetical to the values of freedom and equality which America so stubbornly represents. Yet, despite my anathema, Queen Elizabeth II proved each and every day her own virtue and the value of the traditional institution in the face of a tumultuous and rapidly liberalizing world. Since her birth in 1926, Queen Elizabeth has witnessed the British Empire’s fall and modern Britain’s rise, rapid and near universal liberalization, and the uncountable scores of events, crises, and changes that one can place in her lifetime. So, how did a traditional monarch capture the hearts of millions of people over so many decades? **The answer for Queen Elizabeth II lay in her irreproachable dignity, grace, and ethic that made her a paragon of virtue transcending era, nationality, and even popular culture.**

As commentators and mourners alike observed, Queen Elizabeth II somehow turned a life of ultimate luxury and privilege into one of courageous service. In a society that so enshrines the individual and their prerogative, it becomes easy to overlook or even disparage her carefully maintained neutrality. This neutrality allowed Queen Elizabeth II to appeal to and find common ground with so many of her subjects irrespective of background or era. She provided a blank slate onto which the nation and the individual could transcribe their struggles and triumphs. Queen Elizabeth’s neutrality should stand as a lesson that, even in a world that gives so much merit to those who stand loudly and brashly, there is virtue in standing for temperance and dignity. 

**Queen Elizabeth’s longevity of both rule and popularity reflect the skills of an expert survivalist.** Particularly, it highlights a distinguished ability to separate the transient from the eternal, and the resulting ability to fulfill the duties of the monarch while remaining above political fray and family controversy. As such, she cemented herself as a permanent figure transcending the troubles of the time and became a part of the bedrock of modern Britain. She could be relied upon as a figure and heartbeat during times of strife and celebration alike. Queen Elizabeth’s crucial role in the national identity of Britain begs introspection upon American society: whom do we turn to in times of crisis and change? Some might say the president, but it seems increasingly so that only half can do so at one time. Others turn to the Constitution and the founding values it enumerates, but even those seem to be increasingly contentious. These pieces of America, people and ideas which we can look to for guidance and unity seem to dwindle by the day. 

Yet, at risk of sounding trite, **I believe that Queen Elizabeth II proves that common ground and the resulting mutual respect are not yet relics**. Politicians and citizens alike can learn something from Queen Elizabeth’s unwavering virtue: the only path to a more perfect, more united union is through unwavering commitment to dignity and respect regardless of party or ideological affiliation.
