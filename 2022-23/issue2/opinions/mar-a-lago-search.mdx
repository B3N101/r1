On August 8, 2022, while former U.S. President Donald Trump was in New York, the FBI executed a search warrant on his Mar-A-Lago residence and found 33 boxes of government documents that were allegedly removed from the White House illegally. **Eighteen of these documents were marked “top secret,” the highest classification level in the U.S. government, 54 were marked secret, and 21 were marked confidential.** Trump stated that he cooperated with FBI agents and the search was unnecessary. He claimed all classified documents had been declassified under a “standing order.” 

First off, the claim that he had been cooperating isn’t the whole truth. In January of this year, the National Archives retrieved 15 boxes of government documents from Trump’s residence, 14 of which contained classified material, but he conveniently forgot to mention the other 33 boxes in his possession. 

**Furthermore, it is frankly absurd that Trump claims to have a blanket order in place to declassify all materials, because even though a President has the power to declassify documents, it is a long process that can’t be issued for all materials**. Lastly, even though Hillary Clinton did misuse confidential documents and wasn’t charged, she was publicly crucified for years, and the controversy was one of the main factors in her loss in the 2016 election. Besides the fact, this situation is totally different because Trump intentionally kept those documents in his residence and obstructed the FBI’s investigation by lying to investigators leading up to the search.

Trump and other top Republicans criticized Biden for ordering this search personally to weaken him ahead of the 2024 election, which seems far-fetched. The FBI has interfered in politics in the past, but the timing of this search doesn’t seem to have political intentions, considering we are still very far from the 2024 election, and Biden just had an incredibly successful summer, politics-wise.

However, the reaction to these allegations against Biden is more destructive than Trump’s possible meddling in this investigation.** At the FBI’s Cincinnati office, an individual with body armor and an AR-15 attempted to breach the building, but was thwarted and killed after a standoff**. Armed protesters surrounded outside the FBI’s Phoenix office, and the synagogue of Judge Bruce Reinhart who approved the search warrant was forced to cancel services after multiple online threats. 

So, obviously, this investigation has created a lot of controversy with some questioning if the search was justified in the first place; if it was a political attack against former President Donald Trump; or why Trump’s home was searched and Hillary Clinton’s was not. Ultimately, the search was justified because they found 33 boxes of confidential documents that should not be in a non-government building. Additionally, I find it pretty unlikely that this is a political attack against Donald Trump, when the FBI could’ve used this search to find other materials not relevant to this investigation, which has happened in the past. 

If the Justice Department does intend to charge Donald Trump with obstruction charges and the unauthorized removal of confidential documents under the Espionage Act, they will have to prove that Trump knew he was breaking the law and he lied to the FBI, or he intended to misuse or destroy these documents, which may be hard to prove. They will also have to explain how this case is different from Clinton’s, who was not charged. **It is important to remember that Trump is currently under investigation in six other different cases, and he has fought his way out of many other cases, so if the Justice Department does want to charge him, they will have to make their case airtight, and right now, it doesn’t seem like it is.**
