2022 was a phenomenal year for the state of R&B music. With outstanding releases from artists like Beyoncé, The Weeknd, Brent Faiyaz, Giveon, and SZA, many big names dropped noteworthy projects. However, while these albums are all notable, the best came from Steve Lacy’s newest R&B project Gemini Rights. For this reason, as we close out 2022 and enter a new year of music, Gemini Rights is this month’s album of the issue.

While many may know Lacy because of his smash TikTok hit “Bad Habit,” listeners must listen to the entire song and album. Now, before we dive into the album, listeners should know that there is explicit language on this album. Although it is nothing near as profane as the language in my first review of Unlocked, it may not be suitable for young children. Clean versions are available.

The album opens with one of the best five-song runs of 2022, comparable to Pusha T’s It’s Almost Dry, The Weeknd’s Dawn FM, and Kendrick Lamar’s Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers. “Static” is the opening track on Gemini Rights, and its calming piano pairs with its deep synth inflections to make Lacy’s minimalistic harmonizing feel even more simultaneously beautiful and eerie. A perfect mood setter and album opener, the song is accusatory and defeated while immediately bringing the listener into the confusion, passion, and aggravation that Lacy feels towards both himself and his lover.

The next two songs, “Helmet” and “Mercury,” are perhaps the most distinct songs on the album. Both have incredibly interesting soundscapes and continue on Lacy’s emotionally ephemeral state that bounces between arrogance and depression through their conflicting lyrics about self-confidence and love. The high-pitched harmonies on “Mercury,” paired with the cowbell and muffled drums, makes listeners feel like they’re somehow riding a horse into outer space. Having never heard a song like this before, it is certainly one of my favorites on the album. 

“Buttons” is the next song and provides a calm change of pace that sees Lacy express his confusion at the presence of his love with his seemingly distant lover. The contrast between the steady beat and the unsteady emotions of his love is what makes the song all that more interesting. In addition, the guitar licks pair perfectly with the background’s glowing synths and static-filled drums.

Next comes “Bad Habit,” the single off of this album that became a huge TikTok and radio hit. Although “Mercury” could have easily been released as a single, I am glad to see Lacy have some commercial success off of this album with “Bad Habit,” because it certainly competes with “Mercury” and “Helmet” amongst my favorites on the album. Lacy’s vocal performance and the bouncing synths make this song appealing to mainstream audiences. A break in the music and a raw moment of Lacy’s solo vocals transitions into the second half of the song. Once again, Lacy displays his interesting choice of percussion as he experiments with a more electronically driven sound. 

After a calming interlude, Lacy gives the audience the most boring track on the album, “Cody Freestyle.” That being said, the song does provide a neat synth line and serves as an important moment in the continued confusion of Lacy’s love life and conflicting opinions on what his next romantic move should be.

“Amber” might be Lacy’s best vocal performance on the entire album. His high-pitched inflections make the story he is telling more interesting to listen to. “Sunshine” and “Give You the World” wrap up the album on a romantically positive note where Lacy seems to conclude that he is committed to this present love he has been mentally bouncing back and forth.

Overall, the album tells a thoughtful, complete, and compelling story with interesting production choices that separate it from the pack in terms of R & B records dropped this year. I highly recommend giving this short 35-minute album a listen because it sets a baseline for the kind of R&B quality listeners should expect and only builds excitement for Lacy’s next release.
