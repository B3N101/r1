Studying is central to every Middlesex student’s daily life. Whether finishing up annotations in the _Iliad_ or working through a tricky trigonometry problem, Middlesex offers a variety of spaces for students to be productive. Boarders and day students alike use these places for both individual studying and collaborative study groups. Confined to the dorms during study hours, underclassmen have less freedom to choose where to study, but can look forward to this privilege as upperclassmen. **Nevertheless, for all students, those special, inviting places on campus that provide an ideal studying environment can easily become havens.** Here’s an in-depth overview of a few of the top spots.

1. The Library. Located to the right of the Bass Arts Pavilion, behind Hallowell dormitory, and in front of the Pond, Middlesex students can be found at the library at all times. Its separate study rooms filled to the brim with books provide students with a Hogwarts feel, and bookshelves with ladders and glass windows even line the reading room on the first floor. Day students in particular often group together in a room to get homework done after a sports game or before a late-night rehearsal. Maggie Cabot ’25, a sophomore day student, describes how **the environment of the library maintains her motivation and focus, as “everyone around you is studying, and especially the upstairs has nice, quiet areas.”** When asked about the library’s collaborative and individual environments, Cabot remarks that “the library rooms offer good spots” for both. Although she is not able to leave the library during study hours as an underclassman day student, Maggie finds that staying at school is better for her to “focus… than being at home.” And, because day students don’t have dorm beds to nap in, many feel that the comfy chairs and couch on the first floor of the library make for a superior study break space.

2. The Rachel Carson Center/RCC. Opened in 2017 and situated next to the Clay Centennial Center, the RCC houses both the music department and Spanish classrooms. Yet its appeal doesn’t end there; its comfortable chairs and high tables are a favorite space among students. Underclassmen especially find it to be an ideal place to study during free blocks. For Cabot, in addition to the library, the RCC is one of her go-to “places for doing homework.” The building has a tranquility that promotes both individual and collaborative concentration, and the live background music emanating from practice rooms is an added focus-boosting perk. Even boarders, who have dorm rooms as home bases, use the RCC for work: for instance, sophomore boarder Mollyana Nuki ’25 says that the building “feels new and makes [her] feel more productive to work outside of her room.” The practice rooms are also ideal for motivated studying, reading a book, or recording a Spanish assignment in a private environment. Overall, the Rachel Carson Center is an important resource for students seeking places to do work, as many students find different ways to use the space. 

3. The Bass Arts Pavilion. Located next to the library, this picturesque building is centered around the arts. With the newly constructed theater and numerous art classrooms, the “BAP” is a beautiful space with sunlight shining through its many windows in the hallways. There are tables, chairs, and couches on all three floors, providing lots of spaces for studying. One of Nuki’s favorite study spots is the BAP’s sitting area next to the Ishibashi art gallery as “it makes [her] feel productive and there’s a good flow of people.” With an atmosphere that’s not completely isolated, yet isn’t distracting, this building has an ideal noise level for many students. While Nuki usually prefers to do her studying in the lower level, she finds the couches on the top floor of the BAP to be a sort of “secret haven” to do work. Those few couches next to the art classrooms provide privacy and quiet, for anyone to work. 

Overall, students find different ways to create the ideal study environments for themselves in these three different buildings around campus. For all students, the perfect study space can provide both the resources and motivation for productive studying.
