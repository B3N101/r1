In the summer of 2019, I visited the Women’s Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls, where the women’s suffrage movement happened almost two centuries ago in 1848. I learned from the tour guide how Susan B. Anthony risked imprisonment to vote, read excerpts from Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s women’s rights newspaper The Revolution, and admired the women whom history lauded as champions of the women’s suffrage movement. Most importantly, I left with the image of the Visitor Center waterfall and the words inscribed on its walls etched into my mind: “We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men and women are created equal.”

The Declaration of Sentiments. A declaration of justice, liberty, and equity for all women. Except it wasn’t all women. Invites to the Seneca Falls Convention solely went to white, upper or middle-class women. The five organizers excluded almost all African Americans from attending the convention, overlooking black women’s rights activists and abolitionists at the time. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton actively fought against the enfranchisement of African American men in order to center their own fight for white women’s suffrage. Even after the 1920 ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment that supposedly granted all women the right to vote, many women of color remained disenfranchised and suppressed. Certainly, the women’s suffrage movement that sparked from Seneca Falls accomplished groundbreaking and incredible things; but upon applying an intersectional lens to the movement, we better understand the diversity of experiences, obstacles, and exclusion different women at the time faced.

The trend of exclusion in feminist movements continues beyond the 1800s. The 1960s founders of the National Organization for Women (NOW) largely deprioritized low-income communities and women of color in their fight for gender equality. Cisgender white second-wave feminists in the 1970s worked furiously to deny the existence of transgender women. Even today, white women continue to be exclusive in their feminism. Mainstream feminist media massively overlooks disparities in healthcare, mental health, incarceration, education, and gender-based violence, all while marketing an oversimplified and attainable-to-all brand of empowerment. It does not take into account the diverse experiences intersecting identities bring to individuals.

A perfect example of an issue women have vastly different experiences of? Abortion. Regardless of stance, there is a clear and notable disparity in the challenges women face where abortion is concerned. Pregnancy-related mortality rates are three times higher for Black and Native American women as compared to their white peers. Lower-income women are less able to afford adequate healthcare, or travel long distances to receive abortions in a state where it is legalized. Bans on abortion disproportionately affect women of color, who have lower levels of access to contraception. Transgender women are hardly even recognized as part of those affected, with white feminists immediately raising their hackles and shouting, “Erasure! Erasure!” whenever transgender people are brought into the conversation. Instead of standing in solidarity with their fellow women and uplifting traditionally unheard voices, white feminists actively engage in the suppression themselves by refusing to acknowledge the privileged identities they benefit from.

Covert white feminism, but white feminism nonetheless, exists at Middlesex. It is not shown through large acts of aggression or blatant discrimination, but rather, through the general lack of interest in anything not self-serving. Large numbers of proclaimed feminists flock to sign up for activities, listen to speakers, and participate in lunch discussions regarding gender equality and women’s rights. In activities of other equally important issues, such as race or sexual orientation to name a few, the absence of these feminists is glaringly obvious.

Perhaps their absence is out of fear of the unfamiliar. Or perhaps it is out of apprehension that engaging in conversations about topics they themselves have no firsthand experience with causes discomfort. But it is only out of discomfort that real learning happens — only through confronting our discomfort can we productively engage in conversations, at Middlesex and beyond, and learn something new.

Though this trend of exclusion in white feminism has remained constant for centuries, I have never believed in the phrase “history repeats itself.” Progress towards true equity and inclusion comes slowly, but steadily; it comes from self-awareness, proactivity, and the courage to embrace conversations one usually subconsciously shies away from. It is as Kimberle Crenshaw says: “Women come from a whole range of backgrounds. If our visions of peace don't include these differences, then our peace will be partial."
