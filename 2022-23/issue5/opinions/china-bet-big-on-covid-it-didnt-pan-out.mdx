As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe, China made a huge bet: the Chinese government, in all its centralized glory, could defeat Covid, return to normalcy, and assert its primacy over the U.S. and the world. Nearly three years later, China struggles to cope with the consequences of its disastrous approach, much less to tower over America.

The case for Chinese optimism and American pessimism was solid in the early days of the pandemic. While a fractious American public engaged in the ugly and inefficient business of democracy, the autocratic Chinese Communist Party decisively implemented their now trademark ‘Zero Covid’ policy. In January 2021 CNBC reported that economists believed the pandemic would allow China’s GDP to surpass America’s anywhere from two to five years earlier than expected. Reuters reported in June 2020 that, in a survey of over 120,000 people across 53 countries, more than 60% thought China responded well to the pandemic, while only a third thought America had responded well. Regime mouthpieces bragged to citizens about Chinese triumph as America suffered. A decades-old vision was coming to fruition: China would economically surpass the U.S., autocratic efficiency would embarrass democratic struggle, and China would prove its superiority to the U.S. and the West on the global stage.

Nearly three years later, none of those things have come to pass. I would go so far as to say the opposite situation has played out. China faces economic woes as the immense cost of the ‘Zero Covid’ policy from both economic shutdowns and government spending piles up. Rare protests in China signify a growing domestic discontent, while international sentiment has shifted against China over a spate of issues, including China’s early handling of Covid. China has even failed at the one thing it held above all else, with China’s own health agency estimating that 37 million Chinese citizens are infected daily since the recent abandonment of the ‘Zero Covid’ policy. China’s vaccine has proved far less effective than Western mRNA vaccines, leaving China with less immunity as Covid rips through the population. Meanwhile, while not without its own problems, America leaves the pandemic well-positioned for the future. Though a mild recession could be on the horizon, America seems to be on track for a full economic recovery after the market readjusts, whereas China has not yet begun their recovery, and other nations like Japan must still tackle pandemic inflation. The 2022 midterms marked a step away from the lunacy of the end of the Trump presidency. Thanks to incredible American innovation, mRNA vaccines have made the pandemic a thing of the past for most Americans—and hopefully China’s reckless reopening doesn’t change that. As it stands, America appears positioned to flourish, whereas China must overcome a host of obstacles.

Another hindsight is that China’s Covid U-turn and America’s relative success reflect a reality which we too often lost sight of throughout the pandemic: pandemic policy is political, not scientific. Though some advocated for it, the notion that Covid infections and deaths should entirely determine public policy is an absurd and dangerous idea. Covid hurts people. But so do economic shutdowns. So does total social isolation. So does online school. Though a thoroughly disgraceful and repugnant man, President Trump was correct to weigh the effects of the pandemic against the economic, social, and mental effects of lockdowns. If we subscribed to the dogma of “following the science” as thoroughly as China had, we would be far worse off than we are today. We need leaders who can weigh all perspectives and negotiate a path forward, not politicians who blindly follow one worldview.

Pundits have predicted China’s downfall for decades now. The early 2020s may be a turning point in China’s history, or a slight misstep in China’s ascent. Nobody knows yet, and most likely will not for a long time. What is sure, however, is that China’s vision of a tectonic shift in power did not come to pass. I don’t know what the next decade holds, but I do know that this decade is definitely not China’s.
