Weeks before the 2022 United Nations COP27 Climate Summit, the world witnessed a series of environmental activist protests across museums and galleries. In this worldwide protest that some journalists call the “largest climate protest ever,” the novel approach of a few protests stood out. In particular two Just Stop Oil activists threw tomato soup over Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers;” Letzte Generation (Last Generation) activists targeted Monet’s “Haystacks” with mashed potatoes; and two disguised activists smeared “Mona Lisa” with cake. Although these masterpieces were fortunately not damaged and such protestors’ motives for vandalism may seem justified from their perspective, **their approach is based on a false perception of what is appropriate and moral, fails to deliver their intended message, and ultimately hurts the cause of the climate movement.**

**Perspective**

Activist organizations such as Just Stop Oil and Last Generation have their own expectations. Take Just Stop Oil as an example, it describes itself as “a coalition of groups working together to ensure the Government commits to halting new fossil fuel licensing and production.” The strong diction means that they will not cease their efforts to bring attention to the issue and push the government to take action, at any cost, really——in addition to vandalizing priceless artworks, activists of the organization blocked busy roads in Britain, disrupted the British Grand Prix, and invaded soccer matches at several Premier League stadiums by tying themselves to the goalpost.

**Their efforts are becoming part of the problem.** In a tense interview with Sky News, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson spoke from her perspective on the UK's rising temperatures, “If [legislators] were doing [their] job properly everyone would be out on the street.” From their perspective, any form of civil disobedience is justified as long as the act recognizes a problem. This problematic view of social change leaves ample discretion for activists to do whatever they perceive as right, not what is actually right.

**Message**

There is no doubt that climate activists today have captured the attention of government officials. However, there is a difference between capturing attention and delivering a message. The literal meaning of “delivering” requires the other party to accept the message, but acceptance has been particularly difficult given the radical nature of the protestors.

The earliest of climate activists, Greta Thunberg, went only as far as skipping school to strike for climate action outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm and later, in Florida, for stricter gun restrictions. Indeed, she successfully delivered her message in the famous “How dare you!” speech on September 23, 2019, at the UN Climate Summit held in New York City. But this new wave of climate activists is nothing like her. Rather than engaging in peaceful protests and asking the government for change, they resorted to breaking the law with violence, disruption, and vandalism.

**Effectiveness**

The end goal of these climate activists is to garner popular support for their cause. **But their radical tactics are purely sensational: they cannot guide the public in a way in which they can act to further their cause.**

A successful environmental campaign inspires, not coerces or confuses, people. In the late 20th century, eager to protect Kakadu National Park in Australia from the destructive effects of uranium mining, an alliance of the local people blocked uranium mines. Their solidarity and determination inspired more people to join in the defense of the natural beauty of Kakadu, eventually leading to a halt in uranium mining.

Pouring food at oil paintings or gluing oneself to a gallery wall, on the contrary, blurs the vision of a better environment and hurts the cause of climate change. To a bystander or a prospective participant, these radical actions convey the wrong message that change can only be brought about by the disruption and sacrifice of public and private property.

**These recent radical activists are not heroes, but mere daredevils who lend themselves to the very evil they condemn. True civil disobedience is not just a collective effort, but one that takes root in and is performed upon the human conscience.**
