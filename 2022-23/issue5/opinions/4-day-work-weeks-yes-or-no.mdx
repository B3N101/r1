The 4-day work model is gaining immense popularity around the world as an increasing number of companies report successful trials of the shorter working week. This surge in popularity comes especially after the pandemic, as remote working has widened many employers’ perspectives on what working conditions should be and could be like for their respective companies.

In the United Kingdom, 100 companies have recently switched to a permanent 4-day work week without a deduction in wages. Although the hundred companies only represent a small fraction of the country’s labor force, the 2,600 staff involved may very well become the forefront of a major change in the UK’s working system.

Adam Ross, the Chief Executive of Awin, one of the largest companies involved in the shift, is extremely supportive of the new change within his company as he declares that implementing the 4-day week was “one of the most transformative initiatives [he has seen] in the history of the company.” He continued to gush about the “increase in employee wellness and wellbeing… concurrently [with an improvement in] customer service and relations,... talent relations[,] and retention.”

Ross’ glowing comments are a clear representation of the many benefits the four-day work week can bring. In addition, proponents of the model have listed other advantages to the new system, including increased worker productivity, a more equal workplace, and a smaller carbon footprint.

Perpetual Guardian, a company based in New Zealand, conducted a trial study of the 4-day work week among its employees, and found improvement in teamwork, job satisfaction, a work-life balance, as well as a decrease in stress.

The results from the study are supported by the current data from around the world. The most productive countries worldwide, which include Denmark, Norway, and Germany, have an average working week of around 27 hours, which is approximately the same number of hours that the 4-day work week model proposes. Meanwhile, Japan, a country notorious for its overworked population, ranks 20th out of 35 countries for worker productivity.

A 4-day work week could also promote a more equal working space. The UK’s Gender Pay Gap from the Government Equalities Office has conducted research which reveals that out of two million unemployed citizens barred down by childcare responsibilities, 89% of these people were women. A 4-day work week allows employees to spend more time with their families and maintain a better work-life balance, which can reduce childcare costs as well as share childcare responsibilities among family members, resulting in more equal working conditions across businesses.

There is also a significant environmental benefit to working shorter hours, as commuting costs and energy usage in office buildings are largely reduced. In particular, the US State of Utah conducted a trial that demonstrated the large ecological impact of a 4-day work week. In the first ten months of the project, Utah calculated a saving of $1.8 million US dollars in energy costs from closing office buildings on Friday. It also estimated a saving of 12,000 metric tons of CO2 when including the decrease in commuting costs.

However, critics of the 4-day work week have cited concerns regarding working hours, cost-effectiveness, and whether or not certain businesses or industries can truly adapt to the new model.

Although the 4-day work week aims to reduce working hours and increase productivity, the model can be approached in the wrong way if employees are expected to work the same number of hours in fewer days. This approach is counterproductive as the longer work day is likely to increase working stress as well as decrease productivity levels, further disrupting the work-life balance.

Additionally, the switch from a typical five-day work week to the 4-day work model requires a complete readjustment within each company, and may not be a feasible change for many due to a lack of the right resources, technology, and workplace culture. While there are many benefits to the new working model, the type of industry a company belongs in, the size of the company, and other factors also all come into play when making this significant decision.

The momentum of the 4-day work week does not seem to be slowing down as companies in countries around the world are conducting their own trials of the new model. Though research has shown clear benefits to the 4-day work week, each business should carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages before making the switch.

Ultimately, as technology continues to develop, it is important that companies keep an open mind not just towards the 4-day work week, but also other future models that may come into play. After all, a 4-day work week may seem far-fetched now, but the globally accepted 5-day work week was not always the norm.
