Participating in clubs at MX can be a daunting task. How much time can I commit? Will my extracurricular pursuit impair my schoolwork? Am I qualified enough to join the club? Did they order Sorrento’s for the meeting?

The sheer number of clubs—all claiming to be the best, of course—also makes club participation difficult. I interviewed three club heads at MX to find the answer to what we’re all wondering: what is the superior club at Middlesex?

**Club 1: Finance Club**

First, I interviewed Luke Power ’24 about his beloved Finance Club. Luke is known as an avid, calculated investor and enthusiastic co-head for Middlesex’s finance club. The finance club meets every Monday in the Barron room during lunch. Luke summarizes **finance club as a “club that seeks to invest a portfolio of real money that's around 26,000 dollars** [at the time of the interview].” The goal of the club is to “work to create a strong performance for the student-run portfolio and educate club members,” he adds, values which Power strongly upholds. 

The club is highly organized, with a tiered membership based on prior knowledge and group projects that members work on during their own time. Power claims that initial meetings had to be quite formal as students were obtaining crucial investment information, but has progressively relaxed over time, while still maintaining its still slightly formal environment compared to other clubs. Most importantly, Power argues that the uniqueness of the club lies in being able to invest such a great amount of real money, since members can get “real world experience” of financial management. Power’s engaging air as club head is undeniable—he presents slideshows to students, writes thoughtfully composed all-school emails, and advises students on how to handle their money, setting the club apart from the rest.

**Club 2: Chess Club**

Chess Club has a strong following of about twenty loyal members, making it quite a popular club at Middlesex. I spoke with co-head Andy Chefetz ’23 to discuss the inner workings of the chess club. While proclaiming that co-head Isaac Scribner ’23 contributes “recruiting” capabilities to grow the brand of the club, Chefetz titles himself as the “better chess player,” a commentary which exemplifies the friendly yet fiercely competitive environment of the club. 

Chess club is a consistently scheduled club; members compete every week during Friday lunch block. Andy keeps the club exciting by playing a variety of types of chess; Chess Club doesn’t stick solely to traditional chess. “We keep it exciting,” says Chefetz. Though the club is a more diligently organized and consistently attended one, Andy tries to make the club “not too structured.” The club also upholds an atmosphere of inclusivity, as “everyone plays a game or two per meeting,” according to Chefetz. Chess club sacrifices food options as Chefetz says, “we meet every week so it lessens our budget,” a fact that students may at first find tragic until the realization strikes that Friday is already pizza and wings day in the dining hall. 

Additionally, **one could argue that the Chess Club’s lack of food as an incentive to attend meetings proves the dedication of its members based on interest rather than appetite**—a reality the finance club lacks. Overall, Chess club seems to be a more relaxed environment as opposed to finance club, yet still maintains structure to allow members to truly pursue their passion for the game of chess. If the relationship between Scribner and Chefetz does not crumble in light of Andy’s comments proclaiming chess superiority, Chess Club will prosper for the foreseeable future.

**Club 3: Sports Analytics Club**

Interested in being the next Stephen A. Smith of MX? The Sports Analytics club has got you covered. Headed by a one man crew in the form of Noah Pavlov ’24, this group is discussion-based and analyzes sports statistics as well as general fan opinions. According to Pavlov, the club meets “every couple weeks” instead of weekly, and has a core following of around 25 members that attend all meetings. 

In contrast to the finance club, the environment at sports analytics club is much more relaxed, yet, like the previously mentioned clubs, is diligently organized, with Pavlov himself presenting slideshows to members. Noah engages members through “sports-focused debate [and] data analysis that facilitates dialogue… on statistical grounding with a variety of sports topics.” The club offers food choices, including the tempting Sorrento’s, every so often. Overall, sports analytics club is less formal than the previously aforementioned clubs, benefiting students that are simply excited about sports.

These are only three of the many amazing clubs on campus. Thus, **the problem persists of too many enticing options.** Overall, it’s truly up to students to decide what type of club environment they are looking for.
