The memory of gathering on the circle with Choices groups for the first time during orientation week, September sunlight peeking through low clouds, might still linger in the back of freshmen’s minds—a simultaneously monumental and potentially cringey memory. Indeed, having the courage to meet new people and strike up a conversation, even within an intimate group of people, can be hard and is definitely one of the most challenging goals freshmen hope to accomplish as they progress through Middlesex. For the past three weeks, such challenges have been discussed in depth in Choices groups amongst groups of freshmen, senior peer supporters, and two faculty leaders. 

All new freshmen, including myself, will inevitably encounter stereotypical high-school dilemmas and obstacles. **The goal of Choices is not only to make these challenges more approachable, but also to get to know other freshmen and to become more mindful and intentional about the choices we make.** Managing friendships and withstanding peer pressure can be hard. Choices groups focus on positive communication tactics that can serve as the building blocks for healthy relationships. Would the 130 day streak on snapchat with someone be considered to be a meaningful relationship? Probably not. How about talking to a teammate everyday during practice? Probably yes. Everyone interprets relationships distinctively and has their own definitions—making communication with others even more vital to maintain healthy relationships.

Freshmen also evaluate several case scenarios. What if two roommates run into conflict surrounding the balance of sleeping, studying, and socializing? This is just one of many realistic example scenarios that Choices groups have evaluated. The 2-3 senior supporters guide the conversation and give advice on how to handle the scenario. Abby Tribush ‘26 said, “**Choices is a nice, comfortable environment for everyone to learn about certain experiences that we will face and it’s nice that we have some senior leaders there to help and lead the conversation**.” Gina Zhao ‘26 pointed out as well that “my teachers have been a great help during the conversation and we talked about deep conversations about teenagers’ behaviors and challenges we might face in the school.”

In addition to friendships and peer pressure, keeping a healthy, balanced living in the Middlesex community can be challenging. During Choices meetings, freshmen have been thinking about the choices we can make to lead a healthy life, both physically and mentally. Pressure to get As, perception of what others think, self-doubt, and social media are major factors that can affect students’ mental health. Choices meetings also strive to make freshmen more aware of the mental health resources available on campus, and hope to make us feel encouraged to speak up if we feel we are not getting enough support. 

Besides learning about how to tackle various problems at school, **the simplest help that Choices provide is an intimate setting of peers**. Kelly Marchand, one of the Choices group faculty leaders, pointed out that “during the first day of the circle, most of us didn’t know each other. Nobody wanted to take the lead, nobody wanted to step up, but by the end, I feel people are braver to speak up and tell what they thought.” These groups are unique because they bring together a variety of freshmen who otherwise might have little opportunity to interact with one another, and provide new freshmen-faculty connections. Sixing Wang ‘26 pointed out that one of the most supportive aspects of the groups are “better connection with the faculty leaders of the choices group.” Zhao agrees: “teachers are always great resources to help freshmen, especially,” she commented. From the adult’s point of view, Marchand is also grateful to be connected with students who she doesn’t teach. And the peer supporters’ role can not be underestimated in these groups, as they are able to shed light on experiences they have directly faced before.

**Thus, thanks to the weekly choices meetings, freshmen have become more prepared for and excited about the high school experience that lies ahead.** That said, freshmen are still trying to figure out who they are and what they want to accomplish during their four years here. It may be academic success, or to gain new relationships, or anything in between. But none of it will come easily, and Choices, in an intimate, welcoming setting, has helped prepare freshmen for the challenges that are to come.
