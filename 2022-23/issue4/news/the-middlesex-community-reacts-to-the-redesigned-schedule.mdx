Middlesex is a hectic place to be. Between academic assignments, athletic requirements, and extracurriculars, students are often left overwhelmed and exhausted. One element of the Middlesex lifestyle in particular holds the power to change this: the daily schedule. **The Middlesex schedule is at the core of the everyday MX experience and guides the lives of students and faculty alike.** The current model, last reviewed in 1998, has sustained the school for over two decades without change.

In December 2021, however, an initiative to review the current schedule emerged. The initiative, spearheaded by faculty and staff members of the schedule task force including Ashok Pillai, Rachel Berube, Ryan DuBray, Courtney Fein, Eric Kester, Brenna Morrissey, and Emily Teevens, devised a thorough, three-phase plan spanning over a year for reviewing and redesigning the schedule.

The first phase consisted of conducting internal research within the school community; the task force, through facilitating discussion sessions and conducting surveys, gathered data from trustees, faculty, students, parents, and alumni. The second phase was the external research phase, and the team interviewed and visited many other schools to learn about their schedules. The third and final phase was developing a schedule prototype; with three different models created and help from various department heads, the task force received responses from students and faculty to develop a prototype that combined the best elements of all three. The team revealed this prototype to the student body in an assembly meeting on September 9. Currently, the schedule is undergoing a refinement process before being recommended to the Head of School.

But what prompted the initiative for this change? The answer to that lies in the pandemic. “Because of COVID, we’ve had to run five different schedules over a two-year period,” Ashok Pillai, head of the schedule task force, said. “It affirmed what we had already realized: **we needed to review the schedule and see if it could be improved upon.”**

According to the data collected, a majority of the community hoped for a schedule that allotted longer time for certain courses, better accommodated the advising program, had a less frenzied pace, and allowed for daily balance. Popular demands included having more consistency (fewer special schedules), later start times of the academic day, later start times of study hours, more unscheduled time, and the elimination of Saturday classes. Thus, with many varying demands, the task force rose to the challenge of creating a schedule that addressed the community’s requests as well as possible.

The proposed schedule has numerous differences from the current one. New flexible blocks in the mornings allow students to get extra help with classes or sleep in. Time allotted for athletics is tiered according to student commitment to the sport. Classes meet four times a week instead of five, with up to two of those classes extended to hour-long blocks. There is a longer transition period between classes and athletics, a designated one-hour assembly block on Fridays for community programming or speakers, and study hours have been moved from 7:30-9:30pm to 8-10pm. Instead of after-dinner rehearsals, choral groups now almost exclusively meet during lunch hours in the academic day. From 6-7:30pm most nights, there is a ‘flex’ time where no school-run activities are held. The biggest change, however, lies in the half days: the Wednesday and Saturday schedules switch with one another every week, in order to balance out students’ class time across the week.

“[The main goal] was to ease the relentlessness of the schedule… both in the day, but also at night,” Pillai said. “By having fewer academic blocks per day, there’s less preparation that needs to happen each night. There are pockets of time in each day where you get a chance to catch your breath, which is harder in our current schedule unless you have a free block.”

Students have conflicting views on the proposed schedule. “I like that there’s some longer classes. It gives more time for discussions in class… to really understand the material and not rush through things,” Kathryn Vinson ’24 comments. “The only confusing thing [about the proposed schedule] is that it switches Wednesdays and Saturdays, because then we’d have… two versions of the schedule we’re switching between,” she adds. She also points out that she likes having the 6-7:30pm flex times at night. “As a club head, it’s nice to have that time to make sure everyone who wants to come to meetings can come to the meetings,” she explains.

Kimberly Guzman ’25 agrees with Vinson’s sentiments on longer class blocks. “Right now, when it comes to in-class tests… only getting 40-minutes is a little hard. Not only would [longer classes] help with homework load, you would get more content in,” Guzman explains. “[The proposed schedule] is visually very confusing, though,” she admits.

Overall, however, students are pleased with many aspects of the proposed schedule, and, if implemented, it will allow Middlesex to experience a schedule designed with the specific needs of the current community in mind—not that of 1998.

Pillai points out, “**we’re not trying to create the magic pill solution that makes the entire Middlesex program, or schedule, perfect.** And so what I would say to students, if we get approval for this proposal, [is to] recognize that our big goals were honoring the full Middlesex experience, to exercise patience, and to really actually give it a go.”
