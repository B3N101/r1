Have you ever craved to travel across the globe with your friends? How about with schoolmates all united under a common academic passion? This year, for the first time since 2019, Middlesex is once again offering students the transformative opportunity to learn and experience local culture through trips overseas after being forced to halt these programs due to the pandemic.

The trip offerings are intriguing and diverse: Classics scholars will voyage to Rome, literary enthusiasts will explore England, and arts-lovers will experience music, theater, and visual art in Berlin and Prague, to name a few.

The Roma and Campania Trip will be a week-long adventure in Italy. Students will travel to Pompeii, or ‘the city frozen in time,’ the bay of Naples, and tons of museums displaying art from the time of ancient Rome to the Renaissance period. According to Aura Rizzo, a faculty member of the Classics department, the trip is the “big payout of all that hard work in learning Latin Grammar.” And, by “wandering through the buildings eating Gelato,” students get to learn about Roman culture by actually experiencing it, she explains.

The Literary England trip will visit London, Oxford, Canterbury, Bath, and the Cotswolds to dive deep into their rich literary histories. Students will get to explore Shakespeare’s Globe Theater and the homelands of many influential authors—including Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and Virginia Woolf. Students will also be able to visit the world’s oldest university, the 1000-year-old Canterbury Cathedral. Ruth Baldwin, one of the English teachers facilitating the trip, says students will get the chance to see many of the “first edition[s] of the books covered in the department’s syllabus,” thus connecting the stories students examine around harkness tables to their tangible history.

Aside from the various trips offered during spring break, there is also a trip to South Africa at the start of summer break. The trip is led by Amy. Gleason, a faculty member who has been to South Africa more than 30 times in the past 20 years. Students will observe breath-taking wildlife and, according to Gleason, will be able to learn about “other communities away from our life” and “make actual contributions to that community.”

Faculty members are not the only ones excited about the upcoming trips; students, too, are looking forward to the departures. Since this is the first time Middlesex has offered trips abroad since the pandemic, there is much excitement among the student body, 75% of which has never even heard of such trips before. Lucy Wang ’25 is one of these enthusiastic students. She is partaking in another kind of trip: an athletics trip. Wang, along with other members of the golf team, will be heading to California during spring break. She especially looks forward to the trip because she believes it will “bond [the team] together more.” She hopes that, in the future, “the school can host more trips,” for they are not only great educational or athletic experiences, but they also can truly bring together students from all backgrounds and grades. The wait is on for March break.
