Despite having a grammy nomination in 2018 for best duo/group country performance, Midland has not been able to muster nearly as large of a mainstream audience as some other noteworthy artists of the genre like Eric Church, Luke Combs, or Miranda Lambert. However, the band has managed to develop an authentic country sound and create a niche in what is becoming a heavily pop-influenced genre. After releasing two great albums, _On the Rocks _in 2017 and _Let it Roll _in 2019, Midland capped off an impressive three-album run in 2021 with this issue’s album, _Sonic Ranch._ 

Mark Wrystach, Cameron Duddy, and Jess Carson formed the group now known as Midland in Dripping Springs, Texas after reconnecting with one another and spending a few months together in a recording ranch. _Sonic Ranch_ is an assembly of some of the recordings they created together in those early days in Texas. However, these cuts were never officially released to the public until the album became available on all music streaming services in 2021. There is a documentary on CMT that dives into the exciting come-up of the group and gives inside footage of how the project was created. 

_Sonic Ranch_ is nothing like any country music that can typically be found on “country” radio stations or playlists. **As the documentary highlights, the group heavily emphasizes the authenticity of their country sound by reeling back on the production and bringing actual instruments into the spotlight.** “Fourteen Gears (Adobe House Version),” a stripped-down version of the original track found on _Let It Roll_, is a perfect start to the album with its whining steel, beautiful background voices, and perfectly blended guitars. 

The album art perfectly encapsulates the album's vibe with its desert landscape and burning sunset, for each song makes the listener feel as if they are in a small town in Texas. Part of the reason the album gives off this kind of starchy vibe is because of its minimally produced guitars and the simple yet vivid storytelling of Mark Wrystach. His southern twang pairs perfectly with the constant flow of steel and the plainly simplistic subject matter.

The simplicity of the album is what brings it to life. **On songs such as “Will This Life Be As Grand” and “Worn Out Boots,” Mark’s storytelling plays like a movie in the listener’s mind** with his witty commentary on alcohol and small-town life's role in relationships. 

There are no bad songs on this album; in fact, every song on this album is great. From “Cowgirl Blues” to “Fool’s Luck,” Midland delivers a uniquely simple project on the back of the steel guitar, great storytelling, and a uniformly country atmosphere. It is hard to point out a highlight, for each song stands out in its own way. Although listeners should experience the entire 42-minute album from front to back, “Texas is the Last Stop” truly encapsulates the greatness of the musicality of this album. The song’s fast and catchy guitar lick and classic country drum rhythm make the listener feel like they are in a beat-up station wagon in the middle of the desert. The song truly feels like the band’s anthem and brings the idea that Texas will always be their home to the forefront. 

It is hard to capture the perfection of _Sonic Ranch_ on paper, but the entire album’s simplicity does not get in the way of the rich storytelling and refreshing guitar usage. Ultimately, the only way to truly understand the greatness of this album is to listen to it for yourself, but don’t forget to grab a cowboy hat and a pair of shades before diving into _Sonic Ranch_ because this album is part of a resurgence of works that are trying to bring authentic country music back to the forefront of the genre.
