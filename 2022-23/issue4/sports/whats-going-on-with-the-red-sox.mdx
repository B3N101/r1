For the first time since 2015, the Boston Red Sox landed at the bottom of their division in the AL East. After a mediocre 10-19 start to the season, the Red Sox seemed to have found their spark as the season progressed, sporting the third-best American League record of 42-31 after a win in Cleveland on June 26th. However, it was clear that this success was unsustainable throughout the remainder of the season, as the Red Sox finished with a 36-53 record in their last 89 games, well below the .500 mark — an unexpected surprise for a team with the sixth highest payroll in the league of $207 million. **Missing the playoffs for the second time in three years, General Manager Chaim Bloom and the rest of the front office need to address what went wrong.**

For starters, they need better pitching. **After the July All-Star Break, Red Sox pitchers collectively posted an ERA (Earned Run Average) of over five and were ranked 25th in the league as a pitching staff at the end of the season.** Of course, we cannot overlook the impact that injuries have had on this roster. Star pitcher Chris Sale only made two starts this season after a rough recovery from his Tommy John surgery, and only one pitcher—Nick Pivetta—out of the starting five played over thirty games this season. With a shallow organizational pitching depth at the big-league level and the upper levels of the minors, the Red Sox unprecedentedly turned to four consecutive rookie starting pitchers for the first time since the 1945 season, showing the impact that injuries and a lack of depth on the roster has had on this team.

However, the problem with pitching is not the only concern that Bloom has on his mind entering the upcoming offseason. 30 year-old superstar shortstop Xander Bogaerts is likely to opt out of his six year, $120 million contract he signed in 2019 and hit free agency, with a sure-to-be onslaught of bids from other Major League teams. Former 2018 silver slugger J.D. Martinez, a consistent but aging 35-year-old designated hitter, will enter free agency along with most of the starting rotation, including their ace Nathan Eovaldi, Michael Wacha, and Rich Hill. They will get Sale and Pivetta back, but are the Red Sox willing to lean on their young talents Brayan Bello and Connor Seabold, or will they pursue some more experienced veteran arms in free agency this offseason?

The biggest question this upcoming free agency, however, surrounds the 26-year-old phenom Rafael Devers. A huge part of their offensive production, the third baseman has led the league in extra-base hits since 2019 and only has one more year left on his rookie deal. With Devers asking for 10 years and at least $300 million, the Red Sox seem a bit hesitant to allocate that much money after reportedly offering around $200 million this past season, making this situation eerily similar to that of Mookie Betts, who was dealt to the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 2019 season and has continued to put up superstar production on the West Coast. **Will the front office want to deal Devers away and potentially make the same mistake again, or will they make Devers the face of their franchise and look to build up another championship contending roster around him?** Whatever the case, with their fellow opponents in the AL East all looking like playoff contenders next season, the Red Sox are under pressure and in a considerably tough spot as they enter an important offseason.
