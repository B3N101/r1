CONCORD, Massachusetts—As of November 2nd, the Middlesex Football Zebras are winless. It seems that the championship team of 2020 is now a distant memory, and the contenders of the 2022 team are fading as well. But that is not how the 2023 Zebras see it.

Faced with the reality that the playoffs are no longer possible, the Zebras are confronted with the challenge of finding hope in a season that is certain to have a losing record. **Where many teams would start to relax and allow leadership to fall apart, the Zebras proudly pursue improvements in each week and every play.**

Captain AliJah Clark ‘23 commented, “Look, obviously, as a captain, been here for four years, disappointed in the outcome of the season so far, but football is all about adversity and what you do when it gets hard.” 

Briefly reflecting on his place as a leader on the team, Clark said, “this is the most important part of our season. We've got two games left, and we're looking at two opponents that we can beat if we all lock in and do our job. So I'd say this is my time to show some leadership, be a captain, and get it done.”

Starting quarterback Ty Fein ‘24 encouraged his teammates “to keep fighting.” Fein added that “Coach Morrissey actually brought up this new thing called no white flags. Not putting up the white flags, not surrendering during games when time is tough, and football is about adversity.”

Unknowingly echoing the words of one of his captains, Ty brought clearly into view the idea that adversity is central to the Zebras. This team is built on overcoming adversity and will relentlessly pursue respect from those seemingly blind to the Zebras’ hunger for victory.

Despite the Zebras’ determination to win the remainder of their schedule, it is important to note the Zebras’ 44-0 loss to the Rivers School Red Wings on Saturday, October 29. 

Fein said the following about the Zebras’ poor performance in the first half: “I think we didn't really come to play. Rivers was a very good team, and we didn't expect that from them. I mean, we expected them to be a tough opponent, but they really came out there and gave it to us.” 

Fein added, “I just think a little more heart from all of our players could be needed, and I think that if all of us take away from the season, the one thing is facing adversity and bouncing back from it.”

After sitting on the sidelines for a few games due to a concussion, TJ Kane ‘25 was emphatic in his statements about the game against Rivers. “Obviously, Rivers was a minor setback, but we got to, you know, have, as Ted Lasso says, have a memory like a goldfish.”

Middlesex eagerly awaits the next breakout from the zoo when the Zebras finally get loose again. Although the team is coming off a tough loss against the Red Wings, Kane says the team needs to “forget about that last week. Look into the next and ready to [win].” 

**The Anvil will continue to follow the Zebras in their first year under Coach Scott and their road to win out for the remainder of the season, as the fire within each Zebra for a win burns bright.**
