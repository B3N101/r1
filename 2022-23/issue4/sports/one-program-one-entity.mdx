As I sit down across from Middlesex’s newest faculty member, I look around the room and note the stark contrast between his office’s arrangement and my own room at home. Where my room has books, shoes, and other tchotchke scattered around, new Assistant Athletic Director and Boys’ Basketball Head Coach Sean Tabb has a pristine, professional workspace. Framed photos and quotes line the walls, and he has a new Middlesex hat in a central place of honor atop a shelf. **The room exudes professionalism, as one might expect from a man who has coached college basketball for over 20 years, from Trinity to Brown to Brandeis.**

Following a four-year college career at the University of Hartford, the Connecticut-raised, Massachusetts-born Tabb spent his first year out of college teaching fifth grade science. He couldn’t hold himself away from the game he loves for long, though, returning to basketball at Trinity, where he was an assistant coach for eight years, and then moved up to the head role for two years before moving on to Brown, where he served as an assistant again for two years. Most recently, Coach Tabb coached at Brandeis University in nearby Waltham from 2013 to 2022, helping the team win an ECAC championship. Now, Tabb comes to MX to coach high school basketball for the first time in his illustrious career.

In my conversation with the coach, one core tenet was emphasized over all else: unity. Tabb doesn’t want to come in and flip everything over in one season; he understands that progress is a process, so he enters the position with an “improve today” mindset. He isn’t concerned with wins (though he isn’t opposed to a few victories here and there) or overall performance, as long as each and every player comes in unselfish, willing to work hard, and develop themselves to become the best version of themselves. To ensure that everyone in the program buys into this goal, Tabb plans to stay involved in all three levels of boys’ basketball, keeping an eye on the younger players as they begin their careers and guiding them towards their potential. “I want to make sure the players know it’s their team,” he says, “and we’re going to work together.”

I believe the difference between college and high school ball will prove to be a major adjustment, as Tabb will no longer be able to rely as heavily on his players’ prior experience and knowledge of the game, but he also enters the fray having coached more next-level hoops than I have been alive to witness. He will look to pass on this knowledge to a very talented varsity squad this winter led by captain Timmy Smith ‘23. **If anyone can have success in their first year of coaching at a brand-new level, it’s Coach Sean Tabb.**
