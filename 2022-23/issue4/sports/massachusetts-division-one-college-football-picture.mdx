As November moves forward, we are in the midst of the riveting college football season. With many national high risers and fallers, where does that leave all of Massachusetts’ in-state Division One programs (as of November 6th)?

Standing high and above all of their in-state counterparts, the Holy Cross Crusaders have glided to a cool 9-0 record, clinching their fourth straight Patriot League title. Now sitting comfortably atop the Patriot League, they have seeded a direct bid to the NCAA tournament. Swiss army knife junior quarterback, Matthew Sluka, leads the team in passing (1,732 yards: third in the Patriot League), as well as in rushing (623 yards: third in the Patriot League). Sluka and junior wide receiver, Jalen Coker, have been the Crusaders’ dynamic duo with Coker totaling 10 touchdowns (first in the Patriot League) and 788 receiving yards (third in the Patriot League) in this explosive offense. **Holy Cross possesses all the tools for a sneaky postseason playoff run beyond the Patriot League.**

Following a transition to Division One athletics in 2019, the Merrimack College Warriors football program has adjusted adequately to the high level of play, now securing a comfortable 7-2 overall record, all while remaining a perfect 5-0 in the Northeast Conference play. The unorthodox dual quarterback tandem committee of freshman, Gavin McCusker, and sophomore, Zack Zergiotis, has been a pleasant surprise, combining for over 1,500 total yards and 14 total touchdowns. **The Warriors will continue to ride the hot hand of both McCusker and Zegiotis in search of the program’s first Northeast Conference championship as Division One newcomers.**

After a 5-2 conference finish during the 2021-22 season, securing runner up to the Ivy League Championship, expectations were high for the Harvard University Crimson. Now 3-2 in conference play, the Crimson are no longer in contention for their first title since 2015 given an unlikely sequence of events: victories to top seeded Yale and Penn and Princeton losing to both Yale and Penn. With their Championship hopes now likely behind them, it is time the Crimson look forward to the 2023 season.

The Stonehill College Skyhawks have thus far attained a 4-3 overall record, with a 2-3 conference record in the Northeast Conference matchups. Their recent commanding 50-10 victory over Wagner College snapped a three game losing streak, thrusting the Skyhawks into some positive momentum as they seek to tackle on their last two remaining matchups against LIU and Central Connecticut, although the Skyhawks are no longer in contention for a Conference title.

The 2022 season has been a woeful disappointment for the Boston College Eagles. Struggling to find their form with a 2-7 overall record, they also sit last in the ACC at 1-5 in Conference play. In their 15th matchup with the University of Connecticut since their first game in 1908, the Eagles lost their first ever game to the Huskies thanks to an embarrassing three point offensive showing. The Eagles’ offensive and defensive units are not clicking, along with Boston College head coach, Jeff Hafley, who himself admitted, “I need to do a better job.”

Last and very much so least remain the University of Massachusetts Minutemen. The Minutemen sport a humiliating 1-8 overall record, last among the Independent division. A historically poor program, UMass or “UMess” concluded the 2021-22 season last year with a 1-11 overall record, tying them for last among the Independents with the University of Connecticut. Nationally recognized as the worst Division One college football team in the nation, UMass consequently takes the spot for worst of the Massachusetts programs as well.

**With many high fliers and some programs perpetuating continuous struggles, the thrilling Massachusetts Division One football race is ongoing and ever-changing.**
