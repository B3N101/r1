Ever since he stepped foot on campus, goalkeeper Aidan George has established himself as a determined athlete and central member of the Middlesex soccer program. However, his success hasn’t come easily: it is built on years of dedication and hard work.

Aidan has been involved in soccer from a young age. He has played soccer for nearly his whole life, largely because he grew up with two older brothers who loved the sport. Coming to Middlesex, Aidan had already played club soccer for 10 years, so he was certainly ready for the intensity and competitiveness of high school soccer. What Aidan loves most about soccer is that it “brings everyone together whether they’re kicking a ball in the yard or on a competitive team.” As the world’s most popular sport, soccer also unites the world in a way that Aidan loves witnessing.

Aidan quickly made an impact on the Middlesex soccer program during his freshman year, being one of just two freshmen to make the varsity team. Although he wasn’t the starting goalkeeper, Aidan is immensely grateful for the experiences and lessons that he gained during his underclassmen years. He credits his growth to fellow varsity goalkeeper Alfonso de Vito ‘21, whom Aidan says “became like a brother” to him. “Alfonso is an exceptional athlete, but more importantly, he’s an exceptional person,” Aidan says. **He appreciates not only how de Vito “took [him] under his wing” during practices and helped him to improve as a goalkeeper, but was also there to support Aidan in other aspects of his life, such as socially or academically**.

Now that Aidan is the starting goalkeeper for the team, he has taken on the role that Alfonso took on for him a few years ago. “I’ve learned to use my voice to be there for others and set a good example,” he says. This leadership has certainly paid off for the team, as Aidan has led the team to one of its most successful seasons in recent years. He hopes that the team can end the season strongly and make the NEPSAC playoffs.

But Aidan also knows when to “have fun and enjoy laughs and the team spirit.” Thinking back on his time playing soccer at Middlesex, Aidan cherishes the escape from school that soccer provided, as well as the team chemistry and bonding that he shared with his teammates. His most memorable moment was from this year’s game on Groton Day. “We were winning by one until the end, and then [Groton] scored, which was heartbreaking. But in the final 30 seconds, we scored and everyone was pumped.”

Though his time on the soccer team is coming to a close, he is excited to see the team’s success in future years. His advice to next year’s team is to “believe in yourself and your ability to keep persevering.”

Aidan would love to play soccer at the collegiate level, but he says that even if he doesn’t have the opportunity to do so, he will continue playing at every level that he can. He doesn’t want to pass up the opportunity to have fun and “be a kid again.”
