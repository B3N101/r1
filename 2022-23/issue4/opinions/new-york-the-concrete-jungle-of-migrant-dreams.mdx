Recently, there has been an upsurge in the number of immigrants transported to the U.S. More specifically, southern border states, such as Texas and Arizona, have transported buses of immigrants to Democratic strongholds. 

Currently, on Randall’s Island in NYC, there is a humanitarian relief center that was created with the intent of being a temporary refuge for single, adult men, many of whom are from Venezuela. They have been arriving in New York via buses chartered from Texas several times per week. The tents these men stay in include cots for around 500 people, a dining hall, laundry facilities, as well as phones for the immigrants to make international phone calls. New York City plans on bringing these single men to the facility after they arrive at the main Manhattan bus terminal, where the government will then house the men for a few days whilst considering the next steps. In regards to families with children, they are situated in hotels.

Emergency Management Commissioner Zach Iscol said, “We needed a different type of operation that gave us the time and space to welcome people, provide them a warm meal, shower, a place to sleep, to understand their medical needs, to really then work with them to figure out what their next step is going to be.” 

Within the plastic-walled, white tents, there is a space in which the migrants can meet with their assigned case workers to discuss their future steps. Not only that, but there is a recreational room with multiple televisions, board games, video games, and more. Within the migrants’ sleeping quarters, there are rows of green cots, each with its own pillow, sheets, a blanket, and towels. New York announced that, if needed, they will be able to double the sleeping capacity of the tents. 

However, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City declared a state of emergency due to the overwhelming large influx of immigrants migrating into New York City’s already flooded homeless shelters. Adams called for the state and federal government to allot the new migrants the ability to legally work, eventually slowing the northward movement of immigrants from the border. Whilst Adams was delivering these declarations, the population of New York’s main shelter system, initially at 61,379, was nearly about to break the 2019 record of 61,415. The mayor argued that the sudden increase of migrants could potentially cost New York City $1 billion in its current fiscal year alone. “New York City is doing our part, and now others must step up and join us,” Adams said.

Before being moved to Randall's Island, the tents were initially placed in a far corner of the Bronx–Orchard Beach. The relocation of the tent shelter costed the city at least $325,000, an expense that wouldn’t have been necessary in the first place, had the city never made the foolish decision to set up tents on a windy, low-lying peninsula that was not only surrounded by water, but was far away from mass transit. Nevertheless, the tents were moved after multiple concerns regarding flooding and criticisms from the immigrants who were advocating against the tents’ remote location. Initially, in response to the backlash, Iscol claimed that Randall’s Island was safe from flooding. Still, the advocates remain wary of their new location, and questions regarding the condition of the migrants and the level of support they will receive have arisen. 

Migrants have become enraged with the city’s lack of preparedness and hospitality towards their growing population. There was a recent protest outside City Hall where state and city lawmakers stood and held signs stating “No Tent Cities.” Left-leaning senator from Brooklyn Jabari Brisport said, “This is a failure of policy, a failure of imagination and a failure of leadership.” 

Mayor Adams’ initially relaxed position in regards to the migration of people coming to New York quickly morphed into a stressed one, as he has grown desperate. Adams asked officials in Texas to halt the busloads full of migrants; requested emergency financial assistance from Gov. Kathy Hochul and President Biden; and had gone as far as calling upon federal officials to help reduce the uncontrollable flow of migrants. The competency of the Adams administration has been called into question, as many have wondered if the administration is ill-equipped to efficiently respond to fast-growing, crucial crises.  

Despite New York’s initially stable and controlled approach towards the steady stream of migrants, it is undeniable that NYC’s government is no longer as nonchalant about the immigration ordeal. While the incompetence of the government and its officials have been revealed, one can only hope that, within a short period of time, NYC can regain its composure to both reassure its current migrants that the city will protect them, as well as its future migrants who have nowhere else to go, except New York for refuge.
