We normally take the highway, but I like when traffic recalibrates our GPS and encourages us to take backroads. We twist down winding paths where there are farms and meadows. I see cows, sheep, and chicken. Alpacas too. We are enclosed under a canopy of trees  as leaves fall from their frail ends. Gold and crimson, they roll in the wind. My gaze focuses towards a street sign: Cochichuate. We keep driving, and upon entering my town, the sunset begins to fade past the horizon. Soon enough, Dad’s smile welcomes me home from a day at school.  

It is not the first time that I seem to linger thinking about that street sign: Cochichuate. The name does not seem to have a similar flow like the other streets because it is fast, and long, and there is a double “chuh.” To me, it seems singular and almost archaic as though it meant something meaningful a long time ago. 

But Cochichuate most nearly translates to “the place of rushing water” in an Algonquian dialect. And to whom this word belonged, I began to ponder about the house I was in, how a vast grove of hemlocks was probably reduced to the few in my backyard. How perhaps there were people who once lived here a long, long time ago? Maybe there would be artifacts I could try to dig up? Ridiculous. 

Initially, the Pennacook inhabited the lands of the eastern central part of New England, including Concord, Mass. As primarily a sedentary community based on subsistence farming, women used to harvest maple syrup in the spring while men caught salmon from the Merrimack during the summer. Blueberries, nuts, corn, and squash were harvested in the fall, and with the coming of the winter, farmers cleared lands, using burning techniques.     

And the Wampanoag inhabited the lands of Southeastern New England, including where I now live. Their society was based on both a matrilineal and matrifocal system. Politically, they organized themselves into a confederacy with a leading sachem while their lifestyle primarily focused on agriculture, similar to the Pennacook. 

Both societies nearly vanished after the arrival of smallpox from Anglo-colonizers, the passing of King Philip’s War, raids from the western natives, and others from anglo colonists during the seventeenth century. 

Today, there are few cultural heritage groups in Vermont that represent the Pennacooks. The Wampanoags, who reside in the corner of a reservation on Martha's Vineyard, are largely forgotten by the rest of Americans. 

This is supposed to be an opinion article. So, I guess my argument is that you have to come to terms with where you are and the subsequent impacts after understanding how history places you there. My core message is that we must do more than just acknowledge that these are the lands of the Pennacook, the Wampoanogs too, the lands of many brave warriors, and farmers, women, and fishermen– we must be thankful. Now, when I go home every night, I travel through one breathtaking tile of forest, completing a mosaic of the natural face of America. I now consider how much of a privilege it is that I have tremendous opportunity and safety in one of the greatest nations in the world. How much freedom I have and how much hope my future holds. Nevertheless, how unfair my personal privilege is, but how it cannot be changed. I am thankful for this complex beauty.
