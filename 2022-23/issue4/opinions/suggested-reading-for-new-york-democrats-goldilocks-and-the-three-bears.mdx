New York City’s relationship with crime, specifically its recent crime surge, should be an example of policy failings from both sides of the aisle. Moreover, it should serve as evidence that moderation must prevail not just in political discourse but in policy too. 

New York City was among the most dangerous cities in the nation in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Over the following decades, the crime rate had dramatically fallen and NYC was the safest city in the nation. But in the last few years, crime of all kinds has again exploded. 

At each point, crime rates and injustice appear inversely related. When New York boasted low crime rates, the disproportionate mass incarceration of minorities ballooned; Black and Latino New Yorkers composed 90% of those stopped under the stop-and-frisk program, a number vastly exceeding their percentage of the New York population. Conversely, statistics from the last three years would suggest that New York City is more equitable than ever.

In 2020, many Americans correctly identified discrimination and impunity within police departments across the country, and New York City was no exception. Safety seemingly meant Stop-and-frisk, mass incarceration, and police brutality, while impunity and crime seemed to be the cost of equity. But, despite what each party says about the other’s policing policy, this proposition is a false dilemma. In fact, safety is necessary to equity just as equity is to safety.

In the name of numerical parity, Governor Hochul and Albany Democrats have lowered parole standards in order to release more Black inmates and reach perfect statistical justice. But aiming for numerical parity assumes that crime is a totally random phenomenon, a notion which common sense clearly contradicts. Further, Governor Hochul and New York Democrats passed a 2019 bail reform law which prevented judges from setting a cash bail on those indicted for most nonviolent crimes. The previous cash bail system was clearly flawed, unnecessarily disrupting the lives of many who did long stints in jail before their trial for a minor offense just because they could not pay up. But getting rid of it is not the solution. Yes, mass incarceration and the cash bail system have both harmed Black and Latino communities, and New York as whole. Yes, both systems, along with a number of other government systems, must be examined to produce just, equitable outcomes. 

But in redressing past injustices New York has created new ones. When New York Democrats prevent judges from exercising their discretion to keep defendants that pose a threat to the city in jail, a troubling partisan distrust of the judiciary surfaces. It is a disservice to all New Yorkers, most of all New Yorkers in predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods. The fact that the number of non-white Rikers inmates is so much disproportionately larger than white ones is a deeply troubling fact––so how does flooding the very communities from which they came make New York more equitable or more safe? Of course, it does just the opposite. Over-policing helps create the cycle of crime and poverty that has for so long plagued Black and Latino communities, but under-policing does just the same by promoting lawlessness and destroying the social fabric of the most vulnerable communities which need trust most.

While scholars continue to—and probably forever will—debate all the causes of crime, one thing is clear: economic prosperity, government services like education and housing, and a robust legal system have almost universally caused crime to fall by increasing the standard of living and disincentivizing crime. Black communities should be free from the harassment and bullets of unfettered police departments and unrestrained criminals alike. The police and law in their most basic function serve to protect our rights: to be free from government abuse and criminal violence alike. Before, New York politicians destroying Black communities through violent and discriminatory policing. Now, we must be sure not to destroy them again by refusing to enforce the law.
