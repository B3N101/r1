It seems that the Boston Celtics can never enjoy a smooth, easy start to a season. Last year, they had one of their worst seasons in recent history up until the All-Star Break; on their return to play, it seemed like they had solved all of their problems, with first-time Head Coach Ime Udoka leading the team to the Finals and nearly beating the dynasty Golden State Warriors. Over the off-season, General Manager Brad Stevens made some promising moves, trading five players for Malcolm Brogdon and signing Danilo Gallinari, who sadly will be out for the season with an ACL injury. For the most part, it looked like the 2022-23 season would be one for the Celtics’ history books.

Then the news broke. Celtics head coach Ime Udoka was under internal investigation related to a “consensual relationship with a member of the staff” and faced suspension, potentially, for the entire season. This came as a shock to everyone. Udoka—engaged for seven years to actress Nia Long—was having a relationship with an employee? Beyond the shock of that information, many were puzzled by the possibility of a year-long suspension. Why were the Celtics taking this so seriously if it was a consensual relationship? The rumors flew. Many reporters claiming to have an inside source hinted that there was more to the story soon to be revealed. In the meantime, the internet, Twitter especially, turned to its spiteful side: many users searched the Celtics staff for female employees and speculated on which of them was involved with Udoka. In a press conference, Brad Stevens and some of the players condemned this behavior, defending the privacy of all employees and refusing to buy into the drama.

A few days later, more reports came out: the relationship between Udoka and the unnamed employee had been made known to the front office and ownership, and was approved, as it was appropriate and consensual. Basically, the management recognized that it was nobody’s business. Then, when the employee’s husband discovered the relationship via a Ring™ doorbell camera, the staffer wanted to end it and told Udoka so. Udoka, however, continued to make inappropriate comments, leading the staff member to report his behavior to the executives. Ultimately, this led to the confirmation of Udoka’s suspension, which will keep him out of the organization for the entire year and likely spell the end of his stint with the Celtics.

When I first heard the news, I was surprised and skeptical of the Celtics’ decision to remove Udoka, given his great coaching ability that brought the Celtics to their first Finals in over a decade. He didn’t appear to have done anything wrong, so why punish him for having a relationship? It seemed old-fashioned. However, now that we see the full scope of the situation, I understand and support the team’s actions.

One choice I’m not so sure about, however, is the Celtics’ choice to replace Udoka with Joe Mazzulla, who led the Celtics staff during the Summer League. Though Mazzulla proved himself as a solid coach during those games, he himself has a less-than-perfect track record; as a player at West Virginia University in 2009, Mazzulla was arrested and charged with domestic battery. The year before, he was taken in for aggravated assault on a police officer and underage drinking. Since it was a long time ago and he was not yet a fully matured adult, I’m willing to give Mazzulla the benefit of the doubt. We’ll see how he does when the spotlight is on him.

As for the rest of the team, they have mostly refused to comment on the situation. They have remained focused on playing to the best of their abilities and continuing the chase for Championship banner 18.
