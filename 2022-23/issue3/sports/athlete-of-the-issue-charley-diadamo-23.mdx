**About Charley:**

Charley is a senior who has been a tri-varsity athlete for all four of her years at Middlesex; she is on the varsity soccer, hockey, and lacrosse teams. Additionally, Charley is captain of the girls soccer team and the girls hockey team.

**What is Charley’s favorite part of being on a team at Middlesex?**

“My favorite part about being on a team at Middlesex is the team culture that each team provides. Being on these teams feels like a second family, filled with tons of friends of every grade. But this sense of community does not stop once practice is over. For example, walking through the halls, I see my teammates and wave, as these teams offer a sense of community and closeness on campus.”

**Who is Charley’s favorite athlete and why?**

“My favorite athlete is Zdeno Chara, a former Boston Bruins defenseman and captain. Growing up, I always thought I was going to be the first female on the Bruins, and I always looked to Chara to inspire my hard work to achieve this dream. Additionally, we both play the same position, defense, so I would try to replicate some of his plays in my game. In kindergarten, I wrote him a heartfelt letter, and while his response probably came from someone on his management team, it still meant the world to me. Furthermore, Chara is a good example of a leader, leading the Bruins by his own example.”

**What are the most important attributes of being a leader to you?**

“To me, the most effective leaders are the people who lead others by example. While many people just tell their teammates what to do, those that lead by their own example and show their teammates what to do are most successful in leading their team to success. Additionally, on a team you don’t have to be the most talkative person, but when you do speak up, your words must motivate your teammates and be meaningful. Also, you need to be able to read your teammates and their moods, as if you say the wrong thing, even if you are trying to motivate them, you will do just the opposite. Going along with that, you must accept the responsibility to be tough on people if it’s for the greater good of the team.”

**What is your greatest high school athletic achievement so far?**

“My greatest athletic accomplishment was when my soccer team made it to the quarter finals of the ISL tournament.”

**What advice would you give to future Middlesex athletes?**

“The advice I would give is to make sure you are still playing a sport because you love it, not because you feel obligated to play it. Additionally, learning how to manage your time is key, and you must realize that playing a sport at Middlesex means you have to make sacrifices to play it. However, if you have a true passion for your sport, it will feel worth it to sacrifice some social time with your friends to play it.”
