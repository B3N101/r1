As we slowly approach the near halfway point of Fantasy Football, teams have begun to solidify their league standing and establish their level of contention to win it all. However, **trades can still transform a struggling team to a legitimate championship contender.** With trades, especially at this point in the season, there are some key philosophies and trade targets to keep in mind.

Prioritize 2:1 trades where you are receiving the single more talented piece. A dynamic star that locks in as a weekly starter holds more value than two potentially bench or flex-level pieces splitting the value of a true fantasy stud. 2:1s are always better for the team getting the one player.

This year, **the best rosters will have at least one, or maybe even two, of the five difference makers**. These difference makers are the top three quarterbacks and the top two tight ends. They all present unmatched ceilings that no streamer or mid-level starting play could replicate. The three target quarterbacks are Josh Allen, Jalen Hurts, and Lamar Jackson. As for the tight end position, Travis Kelce and Mark Andrews stand well beyond the rest of the competition. **Target them as well.** Teams that have any of these players will be extremely difficult to take down as these players are all among the best at their position (from a fantasy perspective). Yes, it is still possible to win without these five, but not nearly as easy with any of them on a roster. Regardless of your league standing, inquire and see if they are available for trade; this would likely take the form of a 2:1 deal where you would be sending away two players and receiving one of these bonafide difference makers. However, if you have any one of these players, do not trade them away for a deal that would likely serve as mere depth for you. Unless you are receiving a trade that’s egregiously in your favor, such as two RB1s in exchange for one of these five players, do not take offers.

Moving beyond the five difference makers, there are a number of other trade targets that would cost you much less to acquire. Following Rashaad Penny’s season ending injury, rookie Kenneth Walker steps into a sizable role as the Seahawks’ lead running back. His rest of season floor is a low end RB2, but he boasts a top ten ceiling. His trade value will likely be set at that of an RB2, but with his top ten potential, try and get him at this bargain value. He will get nearly all of the carries and red zone looks in this competent Seattle offense that has been a pleasant surprise. Walker was the best pure rusher in his draft class, and the Seahawks took him early off the draft board. Trust that his college skills will translate to the professional level. Buy in now while you still can.

Another buy low is wide receiver Romeo Doubs of the Green Bay Packers. He’s coming off a dud game and should be relatively easy to trade for. Although he has struggled recently, the upside he possesses outweighs. His involvement is also fantastic as he has played at least 86% or more of the snaps in three straight weeks and already has a 17% target share on the season as a rookie. Rookies, wide receivers in particular, tend to break out in the second half of the season, and with Aaron Rodgers throwing to him, a near full-on breakout is not out of the question for Doubs. Moving forward, he is at least a flex value play, but could easily match WR2 value in his high volume role in this Green Bay offense. Try to package two quality depth level players to obtain Doubs.

No matter where you stand at this point in the season, it is not too late to make a playoff push. An effective trade can lift you into serious playoff contention. Use this information, and get trading. Good luck!
