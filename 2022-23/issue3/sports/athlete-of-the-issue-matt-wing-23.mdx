It’s rare for someone to rise to athletic dominance as quickly as Matt Wing. In the summer before coming to Middlesex, Matt planned to be a soccer, hockey, and lacrosse player — he was even a lacrosse recruit to Middlesex. He started playing these three sports at a very young age, almost as long as he can remember. Matt didn’t start running until sixth grade, and he didn’t take it too seriously in the beginning. As a member of his middle school’s cross country team, he ran only one mile a day, using it as an opportunity to build his fitness in preparation for the lacrosse season. He had never even tried track and field or nordic skiing before high school.

However, he soon switched to cross country after his mom convinced him to try it out in order to maintain his fitness. After quickly making an impact on the Varsity cross country team, Matt knew that running was for him. Three years later, he is now a captain of the cross country, nordic skiing, and track and field teams.

There is no doubt that Matt is one of the most accomplished runners in recent Middlesex history. He earned All-NEPSAC and All-ISL honors in cross country as only a freshman, and he has continued to do so during all years. Most impressively, he won the Division Two New England Championship for cross country and the 800-meter race in track and field last year. He was also named an All-American for finishing in 4th place in the 1600m sprint medley relay at the Nike Outdoor Track and Field Nationals along with fellow Middlesex runners Lucas Mylon ‘23, Alijah Clark ‘23, and Malcolm Clark ‘24.

Although Matt’s teammates initially through his outstanding performance was the primary drive behind his switch to running, there’s one thing that kept drawing Matt back to the cross country and track teams, and it is the same thing that he now tries to foster for the younger runners: the sense of community. Even though running is an individual sport, Matt has found that “everyone is accepting of every level of runner, and every person wants to see each other succeed.” He loves to see his teammates push each to the brink of collapse, as he believes that those moments are what make the team better. Matt’s favorite memory as a Middlesex Zebra is from his freshman year. The Middlesex team narrowly lost to rival Roxbury Latin in the ISL championships, but they came back the next week and triumphantly took the New England Championship title.

Matt says that he’s grown immensely over his time at Middlesex. By having to balance academics with his long training sessions, Matt has become better at time management. More importantly, he has learned to persevere and push through the pain, allowing him to become stronger each day.

In the immediate future, Matt is hoping to lead the cross country and track and field teams to win the ISL and New England Championships, and he hopes to help each runner improve and push their limits by the end of the season. He also hopes to foster the tight-knit team culture that has given him so much. Starting next year, Matt will run for the cross country and track and field teams at Brown University.
