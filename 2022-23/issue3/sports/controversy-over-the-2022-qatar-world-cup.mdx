On December 2, 2010, then FIFA President Sepp Blatter announced Qatar as the 2022 World Cup Host. Qatar’s World Cup bid was said to be based upon developing soccer culture in the Middle East and bridging the gap between the Arab world and the West. **The decision, however, immediately sparked controversy throughout the soccer world.**

There have since been numerous allegations of bribery within FIFA’s executive committee, all of which FIFA and Qatar officials have denied. In 2014, FIFA sent US lawyer Michael Garcia to investigate bribery allegations against Qatar. FIFA initially released a 42-page summary of Garcia’s 430-page report — Garcia deemed their summary “materially incomplete,” with “erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions” — and later, pressured by a notable German newspaper, Garcia’s full report in 2017.

While the document contained no incriminating evidence, it did reveal that “bid teams operated in an environment where a number of [voters] did not hesitate to exploit a system that in certain respects did not bind them to the same rules applicable to bid teams,” with some FIFA officials having “sought to obtain personal favors or benefits.” For example, Qatar engaged in inordinate amounts of lobbying, estimated by _The Guardian_ to have spent almost $200 million on their bid — over four times as much as any other country. Yet Garcia’s investigative facilities were also limited, and in April 2020, the US Department of Justice accused three senior FIFA officials of taking bribes to vote for Qatar.

Other areas of controversy involve Qatar’s unsuitable weather, lack of football history, and insufficient infrastructure. Due to its extreme summer heat, with daily high temperatures averaging well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, Qatar has had no choice but to move the tournament to Winter. Taking place from November 21 to December 18, the tournament conflicts with both the holiday season and major European league schedules. As a result, the Big Five European football leagues and the UEFA’s three club competitions will all see mid-season breaks and overcrowded schedules.

In addition, Qatar, whose team ranks 50th in the world according to FIFA, lacks any substantial football history –– and 113th at the time it was appointed host –– only passing the quarter finals of the AFC Asian Cup once in 2019, and never before qualifying for a World Cup. Not only has Qatar therefore taken away a valuable spot from juggernauts such as Italy or Colombia, but its inexperience shows in its lack of proper sporting infrastructure. Coupled with a population less than the total attendance of each of the past four World Cups, Qatar has had to spend an estimated $220 billion on new stadiums, hotels, metro networks, and airports, which is over fifteen times Russia’s record $14 billion price tag in 2018.

Most significantly, Qatar has faced the greatest pushback for its alleged human rights violations, slavery, and deaths. Under the Kafala system, Qatar has exploited and abused thousands of primarily South Asian migrant workers. Workers continue to face dangerous working conditions and unpaid wages; needing permission from their employers to change jobs or leave the country, many workers have thus been forced to sign false statements that their wages have been paid. One Nepalese construction worker pleaded, “Please tell me, is there any way to get out of here?...We are going totally mad.” He was unpaid for seven months and kept against his will in Qatar for three months. In a 2021 study, _The Guardian_ reported that well over 6,500 migrant workers have perished in Qatar’s bloody construction campaigns.

Only under the scrutiny of human rights organizations such as Amnesty International has Qatar attempted to make any changes. However, Qatar took two years to implement its plan of abolishing the Kafala system and raised the minimum wage to only 1,000 riyals, or $275, a month –– still a laughably inadequate amount. **Indeed, Qatar has demonstrated little interest in better conditions for its migrant workers.** Just this August, Qatari authorities arrested and deported at least 60 migrant workers for protesting working conditions. We can only hope that these events will serve as a warning against what greed can truly amount to.
