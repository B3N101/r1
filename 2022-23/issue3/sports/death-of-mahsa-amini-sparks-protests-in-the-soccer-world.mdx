A human rights group, OpenStadiums, has written to FIFA, the international government body of soccer, demanding that Iran be kicked out of the World Cup in Qatar due to the recent death of Mahsa Amini and the repression of Iranian women throughout the country.

Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman from northwest Iran, while visiting Tehran, was arrested by the morality police of the Islamic Republic of Iran for allegedly breaking Iran’s Islamic dress code that requires women to wear headscarves, or hijabs. Following her arrest, Amini fell into a coma and died in police custody on September 16. Amini’s family believes mistreatment by the police is the cause of her death.

Amini’s arrest and death immediately sparked widespread protests throughout Iran. The first protest was on September 19th in Saqqez district of Kurdistan. Since then, the protests have spread to 105 cities across Iran. There have been many clashes between protesters and law enforcement, resulting in injuries and at least 176 citizens dead according to the human rights organization Hengaw. 

Among the protestors are well-known Iranian athletes, specifically soccer players. Ali Daei, formerly the leading scorer in international soccer history, has protested against the government on Instagram. Ali Karimi, another former Iranian soccer player, has also used social media to criticize the government and support womens’ rights in Iran. Government officials, in response, have called for the arrest of Karimi, and state television has been ordered not to say the names of Karimi or Daei.

The current Iranian national soccer team is also protesting against the government, although they say they are unable to be as outspoken as the former soccer players. Sardar Azmoun, a current player, said on his Instagram that as a result of protesting, “at worst I’ll be dismissed from the national team, No problem. I’d sacrifice that for one hair on the heads of Iranian women.” Many current team members have blacked out their profile pictures in solidarity with Iranian women. They have also issued statements of solidarity and protest, although some, such as Azmoun, deleted their original statement and issued a less strongly worded statement instead in fear of being punished.


In addition to the many statements posted on Instagram, the Iranian national soccer team covered up their uniform with black coats before their friendly match with Senegal, showing solidarity with the protests against the repression of women in Iran.

Although the Iranian national soccer team has shown signs of support, organizations such as OpenStadiums, want the team to be kicked out of the FIFA World Cup. OpenStadiums is “a movement of Iranian Women seeking to end discrimination & let women attend stadiums,” according to their twitter account. The movement argues in a letter to FIFA that allowing the team to play in the world cup gives the “Iranian state and its representatives a global stage while it not only refuses to respect basic human rights and dignities, but is currently torturing and killing its own people.” OpenStadiums also wants FIFA to ban the team in response to the fact that the women of Iran are banned from entering stadiums.

While it is true that the Iranian national soccer team is governed by the Iranian government, and, therefore, is able to be controlled by the Iranian government, it is also true that the team could continue to be a symbol of protest against the Iranian government. Despite keeping their protests subtle due to fear of their government, since the death of Amini, the team has been a symbol of support for women in Iran. This support could continue on an international stage, assuming Iran competes and the Iranian government does not ban players who express support for Iranian women.
