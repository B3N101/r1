Tagovailoa’s recent back-to-back severe head injuries and the circumstances in which they occurred demonstrate the glaring issues in the NFL concussion protocol. Three weeks ago, in Week Two of the NFL, Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa struggled to keep his balance following a severe head strike to the ground. Tagovailoa was allowed to return to the game despite his apparent concussion symptoms, a decision which prompted an outcry from fans and public health experts concerned for Tagovailoa’s safety. Indeed, just four days later, in a matchup against the Bengals, Tagovailoa’s head violently slammed against the turf following a rough tackle. Tagovailoa remained on the ground moments after the injury with his arms and fingers splayed in front of him—a clear sign of neurological trauma, according to experts. Following the injury, Tagovailoa was diagnosed with a concussion and was immediately rushed to a hospital. 

Had the NFL concussion protocol been adequate, team doctors would never have cleared Tagovailoa to return to the first game, much less to start in the second. Despite showing obvious signs of gross motor instability—Tagovailoa could not walk back to the team huddle unassisted—he was still allowed to return to the field. Why? Because specific loopholes present in the NFL concussion protocol enabled him to do so. Both the Dolphins’ physician and the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant (UNC) declared that Tagovailoa’s instability was due to a back and ankle injury rather than the hit to the head he had suffered moments earlier. Moreover, the doctors reached this conclusion without performing any tests on Tagovailoa’s back, instead unprofessionally relying on an “earlier examination conducted by other members of the medical staff” (Archie). However, despite this inadequate reasoning, the Dolphins were still 100% in compliance with the step-by-step process of the NFL protocol. In essence, by questionably dismissing the possibility that a head injury caused Tagovailoa’s stumble, **the Dolphins utilized a workaround to allow Tagovailoa to return to the game at a significant risk to his personal safety.**

Tagovailoa’s second injury clearly illustrated the perilous consequences of this loophole. According to Chris Nowinski, a neuroscientist and co-founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, Tagovailoa’s symptoms after the hit demonstrated a “potentially life-threatening brain injury” (Diamond). Nowinski was particularly concerned about the short interval between Tagovailoa’s two injuries: repeated concussions within a short period appear to correlate with brain swelling, permanent brain damage, and even a life-threatening neurodegenerative disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) linked to “memory loss, depression, aggressive behavior, and sometimes, suicidal thoughts” (Shpigel). The dangerous consequences of consecutive head injuries underscore the fact that the protocols failed to perform their intended purpose: protect the safety and well-being of Tagovailoa. **By allowing Tagovailoa to play in his state of heightened risk for injury, the NFL’s poor concussion protocols allowed a potentially career-ending injury to occur.**

Luckily, the NFL has recently recognized the issues with the concussion protocol and have taken significant steps in the right direction to correct them, indicating in a statement that **“the outcome in [Tagovailoa’s] case was not what was intended when the Protocol was drafted”** (Louis). As a result, the NFL, in conjunction with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), has rightfully updated the league’s concussion protocol to include “ataxia,” defined as “abnormality of balance/stability, motor coordination or dysfunctional speech caused by a neurological issue” (Louis). Under the new amended protocol, Tagovailoa would have been diagnosed with a concussion based on his display of ataxia after the first hit he sustained, and he would have been prohibited from returning. The new amendment is a welcome change that will bring further needed attention to the health and safety of NFL players, but unfortunately, it came too late to protect Tagovailoa. 

Ultimately, as former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III puts it, “the bottom line regarding Tua is LIFE is bigger than football. Health [comes] before competitive advantage” (NPR). The NFL concussion protocol failed to uphold this fundamental principle, and only time will tell if the new amendment will effectively prevent another dangerous Tagovailoa-like situation from ever happening again.
