Do you want to watch a football game at 7pm with your friends and a cheeseburger?

**Meet The Herd, a new term encompassing Middlesex’s student body, formed by students with the aim of increasing enthusiasm at Middlesex teams’ athletic events.** The evening “under-the-lights” games, which happen annually each fall, provide an ideal time for The Herd to gather and cheer for Middlesex, and have been its first major showing.

Layne Morris ‘23 initially came up with the idea of The Herd and worked with the deans and other student groups to make it eventually became a reality. According to Morris, she first came up with this idea from her four older brothers. All of her brothers attended ISL schools and participated in various sports. When Morris went to her brothers’ games, those different fan sections showed “lots of school spirit and liveliness surrounding the players.” **As she noticed that the “fan sections have… been lacking here,” she felt inspired to promote more fan enthusiasm at Middlesex’s games.** Morris started brainstorming and “asking [her] friends and other ISL schools what they wish they had in their fan sections and the good or bad they have.” Then, she met with the deans, discussed her idea, and started designing the logo. The school store also reached out to her, seeking to sell her designs.

To Morris, the best part of creating The Herd is that she “has something that will make a legacy for [herself],” as, after coming to MX as a new sophomore, she wants to make a lasting impact on the community. **Morris has been satisfied with The Herd’s progress so far, and was pleased that “a lot of people showed up with a lot of energy” to the under-the-lights games** and demonstrated their “love and devotion to the school.” For the future, Morris will continue to try to bring more students into The Herd, and she encourages students to “also be there to support arts and theater.”

Brenna Morrissey, Middlesex’s Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Student Activities, also contributed to the creation of The Herd. She believes that the pandemic has made The Herd even more important: “we lost a bit of that spirit along the way in the last few years,” she says. So, with the creation of The Herd, students will hopefully be incentivized to once again participate as active fans at games. Brenna thinks that The Herd, coupled with later start times than in previous games, are what made the under-the-lights games a success. She understands “students’ complaints about how games are all at around the same time” and agrees it would be good if “some games can start later so that people have the time to go and watch the game.” When speaking of how the herd became a reality, Brenna feels that she has just been the “supporting cast member,” helping with all the needs of everyone and building off of Morris’s idea.

Of course, the work to garner school spirit is never truly over, and it would be great to show even more support for all of Middlesex’s teams and artists. So far, however, The Herd has started out strong and has been a great addition to the campus! As Morris says, make sure you follow Mx.Herd on Instagram to keep up with the latest information!
