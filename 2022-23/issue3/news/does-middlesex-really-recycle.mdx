As we pass different buildings daily, from Eliot to Clay to the RCC, the quintessential blue recycling bin and black trash bin become familiar. As we toss trash into those bins, have we ever wondered about the fate of where the items go? Are the trash and recycling bags truly separated? What if we accidentally throw unrecyclable trash into the blue bins? 

Middlesex community mainly uses the black (trash) and blue (recycling) bins with the see-through trash bags for single-stream recycling. **Single-stream recycling allows all recyclables to be put in one bag**—paper, plastic bottles, tin cans, cardboard, and newspaper are all acceptable. They are frequently taken to the dumpsters outside dorms and in the parking lot and taken every Monday and Thursday by E.L. Harvey & Sons, Inc., which is the company responsible for sorting the nonrecyclables for Middlesex. 

No significant concerns are needed when nonrecyclable materials accidentally wind up in the recycling due to this company. E.L. Harvey plays a great role in separating and putting the recyclables to the best of use. With the impact of COVID, more individuals rely on online shopping rather than going to physical stores. Hence, increasingly more packages and thus more cardboard boxes show up in the dumpster. While this may seem like simply more accumulation of waste, these cardboard boxes are actually excellent materials to be re-used down the road.

E.L. Harvey's service reduces considerable recycling stresses for Middlesex, and “it is the best company we had come up with so far," according to Matt Crozier, Middlesex's Chief Operating Officer. Their facility is enormous. It has a surface area of 80,000 square feet and features detailed services. They recycle everything from commercial wastes to building materials torn down from houses.

**“With the huge aid from the Common Sense Club, the Middlesex community is doing great in making sure the community understands the importance of recycling,”** Mr. Crozier praised. He is glad about the current October water challenge too, an initiative which significantly helps raise environmental awareness and prompts individuals to do their part in improving water usage.

While some students may have experienced recycling their whole life, recycling for international students who have not encountered lots of recycling experiences might feel unfamiliar. Thus, there is always room to improve and make the community even better at recycling, through more explicit tips and guidance. Overall, however, Mr. Crozier is satisfied with the current state of recycling awareness at Middlesex, and advises everyone at MX to “recycle as much as we can and keep educating the community about the importance of recycling!”
