In late September, OUT MetroWest, a non-profit organization that “builds communities where LGBTQ+ youth thrive,” sent five speakers to Middlesex for the annual Community Life Symposium. During the Symposium, they discussed matters related to the LGBTQ+ community first in a group assembly and then in smaller breakout sessions separated by grade. Since a discussion of the LGBTQ+ community at large brings the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals at Middlesex to the forefront of the school dialogue, LGBTQ+ Middlesex community members’ feedback on the Symposium is extremely valuable. So, what did Middlesex’s LGBTQ+ community have to say about the OUT MetroWest presentation?

**GSA faculty advisors agreed that the Community Life Symposium was an overall boon for the entire Middlesex community.** “I think [OUT MetroWest] did a good job of having individuals [who] speak about daily-basis experiences that they have had, which I think is always important,” says Mr. Whitt, one faculty advisor of the GSA. “I'm grateful [to OUT MetroWest and Erika Prahl] for bringing people on campus, getting the conversation started and making the kids in GSA feel heard,” says Ms. Smedley, another GSA advisor.

GSA students received the symposium differently. “I think that a lot of it was not very helpful,” says GSA co-head Madeleine Ho ’23. “Granted, I'm speaking from the perspective of one of the heads of GSA, [so] I know about a lot of these issues already… [and] GSA does that [discussion] on a pretty regular basis, and [discusses] all of the terms that [OUT MetroWest] discussed, so I personally found myself not super engaged in the panel,” she adds.

“I honestly hated it so much,” says returning sophomore and GSA member Maggie Huse ’25. “It felt almost redundant, because the GSA… has done so much work to try and put ourselves out there to make sure people are using the correct terms. I thought it was so not representative of who we… are as queer people on campus; to have this group of adults come in and just assume that we hadn’t done any [educational] work [on terminology] was really disheartening.” Furthermore, she wishes that “[the symposium] was more about the individual.” Huse says that her “favorite queer speakers and representatives has been people telling their personal stories and sharing something about themselves. And that’s when I feel the most seen, when I can relate/connect to something.” Huse explains that sympathy for the queer community, in her experience, is built most strongly through these kinds of speakers––during moments “when people are actually able to hear real-world accounts of what’s happened.”

“I find with the program, they had really good intentions, obviously, they wanted to educate people,” says an anonymous GSA member. “But I feel like they could have done a better job, because really, **all they did was go out there and give a bunch of definitions–things someone can just Google.”**

“We’ve never been talked to about the speakers we want to see from campus or the representation that we want at this school…**I feel like it’s very disconnected, like we couldn’t participate or give our own input,”** comments another anonymous student.

Clearly, many GSA students feel disconnected from the very symposium that was meant for the benefit of their community. For future similar events, one member of GSA suggests that Middlesex’s own members of the LGBTQ+ community can contribute to the presentation in some way. By including Middlesex students with a speaker or panelists, the member describes, the whole event can be more Middlesex-oriented and more useful for the MX community. Ho suggests that **more communication from the GSA in the form of preliminary reading on where the Middlesex community is in terms of DEI work would have allowed for less redundancy in the panel** and thus allowed the panelists to delve deeper into specific discussion.

Tom Kane, another faculty advisor of the GSA, says, “I can see what could have been better about this assembly. But I'm actually really excited that there's a lot of GSA members who were like, _Oh, I really wish this had been different,_ or, _we could have been better_. And I think that there's something really positive about that sort of discontent in October… What do we do to keep educating ourselves and educating the school? **How do we do this differently [next time]? I think that's a really important question to ask.”** Ultimately, both the positive and negative aspects of this year’s Community Life Symposium are valuable learning experiences that will allow the Middlesex community to continue to grow in the future as it pursues stronger support for all of its students.
