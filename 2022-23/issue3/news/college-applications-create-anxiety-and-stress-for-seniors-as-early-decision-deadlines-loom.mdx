For many, the fall season at school represents seeing friends on the Circle again, leaves turning orange on Higginson lawn, and getting back into the swing of Middlesex academic and extracurricular life. Meanwhile, **seniors are working towards the next stage of their lives: college.**

Matt Wing ’23, taking the athletic recruitment path, feels that he has been able to “tone it down,” giving him more unstructured time and allowing his last year of high school to be “a lot more chill” compared to junior year. But for many students, including Jane Barton ’23, senior year seems to be presenting “a lot more consistent hard work.”

**In addition to college applications, senior leadership and senior athletic captain positions also add to the already jam-packed senior schedules.** Barton—an AP student, varsity soccer player, day student proctor, and head of various clubs—finds it difficult to manage so many things alongside applications while also allotting down time for herself. Barton notes, “you’re looked up to a little more.” She has to be able to set aside her own pressures in order to help her teammates have a good time at practice each day. Still she admits, “it’s hard to spread yourself so thin.”

Wing admits that, before his recruitment, there were “many nights where [he] was pulling all-nighters” trying to balance his goals to excel as a student while performing as a top-level athlete. Nevertheless, his actual recruiting process felt “pretty seamless.” Even after committing, Wing feels that neither the academic nor athletic facets of his life have changed significantly; he continues to aim for the same top grades and race performances, though feels less stressed and more able to have fun throughout the process.

**Barton takes comfort in knowing that while she feels overwhelmed, her peers do as well, allowing everyone to “all commiserate with one another.”** Wing, one of 14 commits on a different stage of the application process than the majority of the grade, finds his friends opting to work on applications on free days and weekends over hanging out. All those around Wing know, however, that he didn’t unfairly “use [athletics] to get in,” as Barton puts it. Although it can be hard to not have a spot secured as soon as some of her peers, she recognizes that **recruiting and applying for regular admission really just require “hard work at different times.”**

Regardless of the method of admission a student chooses to take, **the college office at Middlesex is a substantial resource in students’ application processes.** Barton deeply appreciates the assistance from her college counselor, Mr. DeGreeff, and his enthusiasm in taking the time to meet when requested. Wing adds that using this invaluable resource and being “proactive” prevents students from feeling too overwhelmed.

Looking towards the spring semester, many seniors feel as though they will finally have the chance to be able to relax. Barton knows she will enjoy “hav[ing] a plan [for] next year,” and Wing hopes his peers will be able to “value fun a lot more.” If he could advise younger students about one thing, he would say that there are times when it feels nearly impossible to get some things done and do a good job on them, but “if you just put your head down and push through, then you’re going to come out the other side doing alright.”
