The death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini has sparked weeks of protests that have ravaged the streets of Iran. The notorious morality police, who enforce the country's rules on conservative dress and behavior, arrested Amini under allegations that she was wearing her hijab in an improper manner. Shortly after, Amini was taken to the hospital where she died in custody. Amini's family said that she was beaten to death, but the police have denied using violence on her and claimed that Amini suffered from an underlying health condition that caused a fatal heart attack.

Iran has a history of protests regarding its economic and political issues. In 2009, there were protests against voting fraud; in 2017, ones about rising inflation and economic mismanagement; and most recently, in 2019, protests against fuel prices. Iran’s security forces violently suppressed each period of unrest. Yet, even as authorities cracked down on current protests, the movement persisted.

The long-standing discrimination against women united Iranians across different ethnic, regional, and religious backgrounds. Many women have taken to the streets to cut their hair and burn their hijabs. Although Amini’death initially fueled the public dissent, the demand for accountability has developed into a fight for the rights and freedom of Iranian women.

The protests have even moved from the streets into schools, as university students went on strike and held sit-ins and walkouts to protest. These defiant acts even spread to high schools, where female students have taken off their mandatory head scarves and refused to cooperate with school administration.

In an attempt to restrain the movement, the Iranian government shut off the internet and blocked widely-used apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp. This disruption prevented Iranians from communicating with each other and updating the international community. In addition, this internet block has made it difficult to ascertain the true toll of the government’s crackdown. However, the Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) reported at least 185 deaths from the crackdowns.

Meanwhile, leaders around the world have strongly condemned Iran's violent response to the ongoing protests.

On September 21st, in an address to the U.N. General Assembly, President Joe Biden declared that "[the United States stands] with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.”

Two days later, the Treasury Department issued Iran General License (GL) D-2. The updated U.S. sanctions guidance authorizes American technology companies to offer a more expansive range of internet services to the Iranian people, making it easier for them to access the free flow of information online.

Many countries in the European Union have also released a series of statements supporting Iranian women's rights and calling for a transparent investigation of Amini’s death. On September 25th, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrel issued a statement stating that “the [EU] will continue to consider all the options at its disposal ahead of the next Foreign Affairs Council… to address the killing of Mahsa Amini and the way Iranian security forces have responded to the ensuing demonstrations.”

The extensive scale of the current protests speaks especially to the younger generation’s resentment towards the Iranian government’s censorship and restrictions of rights. Yet, even as the movement shows no sign of slowing down, the possibility of overthrowing a decades-long regime remains uncertain; however, as the international community continues to support the courageous actions of the Iranian people, the defiant beliefs and movements will continue to persist.
