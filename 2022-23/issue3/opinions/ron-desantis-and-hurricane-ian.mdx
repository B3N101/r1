Since Hurricane Ian landed in Florida, the storm has caused devastation to families, businesses, and by some [estimates](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/07/hurricane-ian-damage-estimate-costliest-storm-florida) presented by Axios, 67 billion dollars worth of damage so far. Hurricane Ian is one of the worst storms in Florida history, as hundreds of people have been rescued from flood waters across the state.

On October 28th, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, made a Fox News appearance with host Tucker Carlson. DeSantis has also been exceptional in the news recently for flying undocumented Venezuelan immigrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard and suggesting that the next plane of these undocumented immigrants would land in Delaware, the state which President Biden represented as a Senator.

On Carlson’s show, DeSantis talked about his request for full federal reimbursement up front for 60 days, pleading with the Biden administration to “do the right thing,” despite not having good relations with Biden throughout his time in office. DeSantis recognized his previous rocky history with Biden and the current extremely polarized economic state. However, he still pleaded with Biden that “when people are fighting for their lives, when their whole livelihood is at stake, when they’ve lost everything – if you can’t put politics aside for that, then you’re just not going to be able to.” In response to DeSantis’s request for federal help, former Florida Republican Congressman David Jolly stated that “there’s nobody in America that Ron DeSantis needs more than Joe Biden” right now, as DeSantis has no other choice but to push for storm relief.

Ironically, in 2013, when Ron DeSantis just got elected as a Congressman representing Florida’s 6th District, he was quoted saying that the federal bailout for the New York region after Hurricane Sandy was “fiscally irresponsible.” The Tampa Bay Times reported that DeSantis said that while “[he] sympathized with the victims,” he could not vote in favor of the legislation. In that vote, DeSantis and Ted Yoho were the only two House members from Florida to oppose the package.

Now that his state is in crisis, it seems as if DeSantis has flipped on his previous position on federal funding for crises. Despite this incident occurring almost ten years ago, the public did not forget about it. When reporters asked the DeSantis administration about DeSantis’s past positions, a spokesman responded that the administration was currently just “completely focused on the hurricane response” and that “as the governor said earlier, we have no time for politics or pettiness” and dodged the question.

However, the claim that DeSantis has always opposed federal aid is not entirely true. In 2017, during his last year as a Congressman before being elected governor, DeSantis supported an aid package after Hurricanes Harley, Irma, and Maria devastated much of the U.S.

Furthermore, in the words of Haley Barbour, the former Republican governor of Mississippi when Hurricane Katrina devastated the state, “there was nothing inherently inconsistent about a conservative governor seeking federal storm money,” as “some disasters are too big for the community to bear the cost to get back to where you need to be.”
