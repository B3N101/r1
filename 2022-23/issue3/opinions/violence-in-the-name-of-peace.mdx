On Friday, September 30, 2022, Burkina Faso faced its second coup d’état this year. The ousting of military leader Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba marks the nation’s continued downward spiral into Jihadist insurgency, food insecurity, and violation of human rights. According to the UNHCR, over 1.4 million Burkinabés have been displaced, while the number of outflowing refugees has nearly doubled since the start of the series of military conflicts.

Earlier this year, Damiba staged a coup to overthrow his predecessors, President of Burkina Faso Roch Marc Christian Kaboré and Prime Minister Lassina Zerbo. Damiba was appointed interim president until the most recent coup, eight months later. Damiba was deposed in a similar fashion as his two predecessors—ousted by a military junta, led by Ibrahim Traoré, the current president.

With the dissolution of the Damiba administration, Burkina Faso finds itself in an even more frail state, with severe unrest from the droughts across the Sahel region and intermittent acts of violence committed by groups aligning with terrorist groups Al-Qaeda and ISIS. One of the main reasons for this military action, according to the newly-appointed Traoré, is to “take our responsibilities, driven by a single ideal – the restoration of security and integrity of our territory.”

**However, Traoré’s seemingly-promising rhetoric cannot conceal his government’s threat to civilians nor its inherent inability to peacefully sustain its presence.**

The precarious political landscape of Burkina Faso is the direct aftermath of Burkinabé politicians’ longstanding emphasis on personal charisma over political vision and capabilities. Burkina Faso has a long history of charismatic leaders, one of the most famous being Thomas Sankara, whose ardent support for nationalism came to define the Burkinabé identity. Sankarism, a term denoting Sankara and his supporters’ fight against neocolonization, went askew and deteriorated into a populist government that acted upon impulse, fostered widespread idolatry and blindness to a popular leader, and misled people with the false impression that all of such efforts help “define the Burkinabé identity.” **A government so dependent on popular support is set to crumble when public opinion is no longer a weapon that combats its political and ideological opponents, but one that backfires and kills the user.**

“40 percent of [Burkina Faso] territory is out of the control of the state,” said Mahamadou Issoufou, a mediator from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Because much of the power lies in the hands of military groups whose sole interest is to oppose, challenge, and ultimately dissolve administrations, Burkina Faso’s plans to return to democracy and peace seem far-fetched given current circumstances. With a defunct National Assembly, a suspended Constitution, and a government that has little to no power to protect its people, the rights of the people of Burkina Faso are in immediate danger.

Ideally, the way out of violence for Burkina Faso is not giving free rein to populist military leaders, but building stronger, more persistent fighters and leaders in the next generation. The potential of education is immense: by learning what is morally right and wrong, children and adolescents have more chances in becoming a positive changing force for their communities and society.

**Peace is a choice, so is violence. To confound the boundaries between the two is not only an act of hypocrisy, but a fundamental corruption of morals that, unfortunately, crumbles Burkina Faso today.**
