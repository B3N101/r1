The ball comes towards my feet. I touch with my right foot in front of me, and I strike it so that it quakes the ground at the back of the net. I shake my teammates’ hands as this specific drill ends, and we move onto another. Then to the next. And the next. After Monday, we do it again on Tuesday, and Wednesday, and Thursday, and Friday, and Saturday.

I enjoy playing with the boys' soccer program– there is no doubt in that. However, it seems as though I have recently become distracted by the foliage of the maples that have bloomed in these recent weeks. I begin to think about capturing the moment with my camera– but then, I realize that I am no longer taking photography as an extra course this year, and that I am finding it difficult to pursue it in my free time.

For me this year, there has personally been a large gap between sports and arts. Similarly, it appears that the arts program, in comparison to the athletic program, has been receiving less attention within the community overall. If anything, it seems as though the series of under the lights games, MX HERD, the different sports teams' social media accounts, and the participation requirement for everyone have taken the spotlight and interfered with the arts program.

I would briefly like to establish two points– first, that the work of the athletics department has been tremendous, and the impact even more wonderful. The school focuses on community by encouraging everyone to attend games, join MX HERD, and be a part of a sports team. Additionally, sports allowed for, beyond the obvious physical exercise, an atmosphere that promotes and builds character. Secondly, the athletics department is not in competition with the arts department, and therefore, the arts department influences itself and moves along its own trajectory.

Thus, I think it is only fair to point out what is quietly being developed behind the curtain, and, for that matter, what the arts department will soon dazzle the school community with.

In the visual arts department, many photographers and video productionists have actually been working with sports teams to take photographs and create videos. Pottery club has begun meeting, and Photo Club has launched its annual fall photo contest. Walls in the BAP have been starting to fill with artwork, and the Ishibashi Gallery has What Our Bodies Taught Us on display. Nevertheless, we await even more student artwork and the next artistic showcase from a professional artist.

In the musical arts department, Music Appreciation Club and Classical Music Club have been meeting frequently. On Thursday, October 12, there was a Fall Music Festival. Moreover, we can expect more exciting concerts for the instrumental and choral groups on campus in the near future.

In the performing arts department, FOS and improv club have occurred this fall. Soon, while the actors and directors are hard at work, spectacles such as School For Scandal, Green Rooms, and other dramas will unfold as we near the winter.

Most excitingly, the arts department will host an art and culture trip to Berlin and Prague this March. The trip serves as the best example to show that the arts at Middlesex’s spotlight will be coming shortly. The appreciation and commitment to the arts department ultimately takes a little bit extra patience. But that's all.
