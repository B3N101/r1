As the war in Ukraine rolls into its eighth month, the conflict shows no signs of slowing down. On the contrary, the war continues to escalate in intensity. Ukrainian counter offensives have been able to consistently beat back Russian forces all along the frontline, with the initiative clearly falling into Ukrainian hands. Ukraine has even orchestrated the destruction of a key bridge connecting occupied Crimea to the rest of Russia, a major blow to Russia’s ability to supply the peninsula and thus retain its authority. As this all plays out, Ukraine is undergoing a fastened accession into NATO that would be just another setback in a series of military and political defeats for Russia and their leaders over the last few months.

For Russia, negotiated peace would mean political, and likely literal, suicide for the bureacrats who rallied the country into war in the first place, only for it to end in an embarrassment to Russia’s prestige and the opposite to the glory which was promised from the war. In growing desperation to retain the image of control and therefore to remain in power, Putin has made escalations of his own. Most recently, Putin threatened the use of nuclear weapons over Ukraine as justified military aims to achieve victory. Living in the post-Cold War era past the fears of nuclear annihilation, hearing the threat of nuclear weapons from the world’s largest owner of them is hard to wrap your head around. Many will say that the threats from Putin are empty, that even he knows that crossing that line would bring irreparable consequences. However, these threats aren’t empty in the slightest: they fall in line with Putin’s perspective on the war and his own political position. To Putin, losing this war would be an incorrigible political defeat that would likely mean revolt from within his circle or directly from the people, ending his reign of power. Therefore, if bringing about a nuclear holocaust and killing millions are necessary to sustain his regime, it’s not unlikely that Putin pulls the trigger in an act of desperation.

To those who are still skeptical about the real risks at play, it’s easy to review Putin's actions over the last eight months to reveal the man’s character. He has already shown willingness to shamelessly break precedent in international law with the invasion in the first place. He has directly terrorized civilian populations with the missile attacks across populated city centers of Ukraine. Thus, the use of nuclear weapons, in the mind of Putin, is the logical escalation for Russia to restore military superiority, prevent dissent on the homefront, and remain in power on a global scale.

While such a possibility is understandably terrifying, it doesn’t mean that nuclear armageddon is all but guaranteed. Putin faces stern external and internal oppositions, and he could just as likely be deposed as the war situation worsens. What should be drawn from the reintroduction of a nuclear apocalypse threat is the fragility of the current world order, where one deranged man in charge of one single nation has the power to destroy the entire planet with his nuclear arsenal at a whim. Such a world order must be closely examined in order to guarantee the continued survival and prosperity of mankind.
