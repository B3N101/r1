On September 30, 2022, Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of four Ukrainian regions-- Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson-- making up about 15% of Ukraine’s territory. This recent, yet anticipated, development shows signs of desperation from Moscow, as it comes after recent Ukrainian victories and Putin’s regime’s poor domestic performance since the start of the war and following the draft announcement, which sparked protests and a Russian mass exodus. Minutes after the Russian announcement, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky released a video stating the nation’s accelerated plan to join NATO. Although Ukraine’s allies have condemned and further sanctioned Russia, and sent more support to Ukraine, it is unlikely Zelensky’s plans will come to fruition. NATO requires unanimous support to accept a nation per Article 10, and that requirement definitely won’t be reached with Putin’s threats of nuclear warfare. 

Russia’s annexation defines the latest stage in the war, marked by Russian aggression and a Ukrainian territorial comeback. In early September, Ukraine astonishingly recaptured around 6,000 square kilometers (2,317 sq miles) of territory from Russia; following Russia’s announcement, Ukraine regained the key hub town of Lyman and the village of Dudchany, both of which are tactically important and within Russia’s so-called newly annexed territory. Additionally, on October 8, 2022, the Ukrainians destroyed the Kerch Strait Bridge, a Russian logistical asset that connects Crimea to Russia. Yet Russia’s response has been directed towards civilians and Ukrainian infrastructure, with the the largest rate of Russian missile strikes occurring in the past few days, leading Ukrainian President Zelensky to call Russia a “terrorist state” on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1579439304707014656/photo/3). This latest spell of Russian aggression, through their annexation and terrorist missile strikes, has signaled a further separation between Russia and the West, as it pushed Western leaders to further fund the Ukrainian war effort. The U.S. has given two separate fund packages of $12.35 billion and $625 million to Ukraine since the annexation. 

Looking forward to the war, I have a few major interpretations of the long term-impacts of the annexation. My first interpretation is that the annexation will prolong the war, as it will ensure Russia’s commitment to defend its annexed territories even if it fails to capture all of Ukraine, which seems extremely likely given the current state of the war more than seven months in. Another interpretation is that Russia will outright fail to defend its annexed territories, as Ukraine continues its recent success derived from superior tactics and Western support, which will be a massive humiliation to Russia, Putin, and the Russian people. A potential Russian defeat would change Russia and the world forever. One result of a Russian defeat could be a change in leadership, which could also cause a Russian exit from the war if the regime change occurs before the Russian defeat. Another result would be more deadly and apocalyptic; with Putin’s continuing threats and reminders of his nuclear weapons, he could hit “the button” if backed into the corner he has set himself up into with his annexation that binds Russia further into the war. Russia’s annexation has signaled a dark time for this world, where an imperial force could conquer its neighbors and a new, alienated Russia that could destroy the rest of the world. Yet, with its current momentum and its allies, there is still hope and a high probability of a victorious Ukraine. With that, the world will continue to closely watch the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, until there is hopefully peace at last.
