Last school year, during “Foundations of the West,” my teacher asked us each to write a parable about something at Middlesex: as parables must, they conveyed a subtle conclusion about our community through the familiar props and imagery. Now, had Mr. Miller asked me to write one about American politics, I could find no better saga than that of the busing and flying of migrants to Democratic strongholds by Republican governors.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott began busing migrants to New York, Chicago, and Washington D.C. months ago in a political stunt to protest the Democratic border policy. More recently, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is coincidentally up for reelection on November 8th, flew migrants to Martha’s Vineyard in apparent protest, despite his claims that he was simply sending them to greener pastures. Govs. Abbott and DeSantis’ political genius allowed them to own the liberals, point out the hypocrisy of the elites, and protest Democratic border policy in one fell swoop.

On the other side of the aisle, Democrats are shocked. One New York Times opinion piece asks, “How long can they go?” It is an unthinkable, inhumane, xenophobic notion that the Republicans would treat migrants as such. But what do the morally outraged Democrats have to say about the border? President Biden, mute on the subject as on so many others, long ago delegated the issue to Vice President Harris, who covers her eyes, says that “the border is secure,” and hopes the problem goes away–but what more can a Vice President do?

Despite her claim, there is a massive problem at our southern border. Some say we have an open border over which droves of migrants illegally cross, some with all types of narcotics and weapons. Others, like White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, claim the issue is inhumane and discriminatory towards asylum seekers. The former pins the issue on President Biden and the Democrats’ border policy; the latter pins the issue on President Trump and the Republicans’ alleged decimation of the migrant processing system. These issues are really one and the same, and probably all have an element of truth to them. If we don’t have the resources to catalog and screen all the migrants that come to our southern border, how can we possibly be able to treat those same migrants with decency and humanity? Conversely, if we don’t even have the resources to process all the migrants at the Southern border, much less treat humanely, how can we possibly be sure of the border’s security?

So, instead of attempting to fix the disaster at the border, our politicians play hot potato with the consequences. Migrant border crossings are at an all-time high, with Axios reporting 8,500 migrants crossing daily. This influx puts a huge burden on border states, as their governors have so eloquently argued by using real migrants as pawns in a political stunt. But their accusation of hypocrisy is not unfounded: the righteous, liberal good Samaritans who receive these migrants fell right into Govs. DeSantis and Abbott’s unsavory trap.

Of course, we should aspire to care for others and help those in need, as the people who sheltered and cared for the unexpected migrants have. Regardless, Democratic leaders seized upon those kind peoples’ efforts and turned them into the ritual moral grandstanding to which we have been so accustomed. They’ve turned this saga into yet another parable of GOP cynicism and Democrat virtue: the grand irony is, of course, that the apparently overwhelmed Democratic cities have received a ridiculously small number of migrants. The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, cried that the city, which had at that time received about 10,000 migrants since May 2022, is “nearing its breaking point.” In five months, 10,000 migrants overwhelmed New York City; 8,500 migrants cross the border per day. Imagine how border states feel.

It is undeniable that U.S. immigration policy needs reform, and Governors Abbott and DeSantis so tastefully brought that fact back to the forefront of politics. Democrats derided this stunt and took the opportunity to ironically grandstand about their virtue, in the process proving their hypocrisy by complaining about the burdens of migrants. Vindicated Republicans smugly smiled and showcased the Democrats’ hypocrisy, ironically doing absolutely nothing to remedy the disaster that is the Southern border. Outraged liberals and smug conservatives sounded off in their assent in their own echo chambers. Thousands of migrants still pour over the border into overwhelmed and often inhumane facilities every day.
