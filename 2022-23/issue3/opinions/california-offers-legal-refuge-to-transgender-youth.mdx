Thanks to tenacious protests and fighting, the LGBTQ+ community has increasingly gained rights and equality over the past decades. Despite positive enhancement in public awareness and support, discrimination towards LGBTQ+ communities, especially the transgender community, remains a fundamental problem. Amidst a range of blatant legislations outlawing gender-affirming medical care, California’s newly passed Senate Bill 107 offers a haven for transgender youth.

The past few years saw increasing discrimination against the transgender population, even brazen legislation prosecuting transgender families. More than 40 bills in 20 states target transgender communities. Notably, an Alabama bill made it a felony for doctors who “prescribe puberty blockers or hormones or perform surgery to aid gender transition of people under age 19.” Transgender youths are denied the freedom to follow their own gender identity, facing the distressing predicament of not receiving proper medical treatment. These bills trap transgender kids in a body conflict with their minds, bringing years of affliction and can potentially forever terminate the possibility of gender transition. The bills signify that discrimination against transgender communities has escalated to a governmental level.

Senate Bill 107 made California one rare refuge for transgender families that face criminalization in other states. Aiming to protect families that flee to California seeking medical treatment, Senate Bill 107 prohibits the enforcement of out-of-state law to remove a child, “subpoena seeking health or other related information,” and “demand for extradition” for providing gender-affirming health care. As Senator Wiener said, “this bill is about giving people refuge.” California offers a choice for transgender youth to pursue their true identity by making medical treatment accessible. In addition, families and doctors facing prosecution for simply providing justifiable treatment can seek protection in California, free from gratuitous penalties. Even more important than its practical use, Bill 107 represents California's firm standpoint to continue supporting the LGBTQ+ community in the unrelenting fight for basic rights.

Some advocates for limiting medical treatments justify their unscrupulous motives by claiming that children do not know their identity, and, thus, gender-affirming treatment can be fundamentally detrimental. They attempt to argue that transgender people often regret their choices made as a child and the irreversible medical treatments. However, according to Senator Richard Pan, much research shows that the majority of children who question their gender identity do not change their minds. Moreover, the usual treatment for children is hormone and puberty blockers, which will delay the occurrence of sexual features, giving them time to reconsider the decision. Once the blockers are suspended, children will undergo normal puberty and sexual development. Unlike the advocates’ surmise, gender-affirming health care is a safe and reversible process, and it will, in fact, free transgender kids from the agony of gender dysphoria. To conclude, Senate Bill 107 is a reassuring voice for the transgender community. Especially in times of heightened discrimination, more bills of this kind are vital to establish a country safe for all identifying as LGBTQ+ and other minority groups.
