Pencil drawings and scattered sketchbooks defined the bedroom of Gabe Custodio Guzman ’23 just five years ago. Having drawn celebrity portraits as a child, Custodio started his design Instagram account, @gabe_got_it, at the start of September, building off his endless love for the arts.

“I love drawing, and I still do,” says Custodio. Over the summer, Custodio took a new step in exploring art. Casually scrolling through the Middlesex Athletics Instagram page, an idea popped into his head: “If I practice and see if I can get good at [graphic design], maybe the school [will] post some of mine.” So, Custodio got to work.

He spent the summer learning about graphic design on his laptop’s Photoshop\_ \_application. After much practice, he reached out to the school’s Digital Media Producer, Austin Lewis, who sent him pictures to use for a Game Day Instagram post. Not long after, Custodio designed his first post for the Middlesex Zebras. In turn, his Instagram page grew, and so did his pocketbook.

**Cross Country and Track runner Matt Wing ‘23 was one of Custodio’s first clients.** Wing contacted Custodio before his final college decision. Wing told Custodio he wanted an eye-catching graphic to announce his commitment on Instagram. Once Custodio received the go-ahead call from Wing on Brown University, the pair met in a Warburg Library study room.

They worked together in a free block before a statistics test to form the design. “As he was talking and putting out ideas, I was working on my computer,” remarked Custodio.

After some final tweaks post-test, the piece was done. A cutout of Wing racing in his Middlesex jersey is at the forefront of the composition, surrounded by Brown University, Nike, and Ivy League logos. In the background, Custodio placed a picture of Brown’s Sayles Memorial Hall and an overlaid transparent image of Brown's logo.

Wing remarked that Custodio “did a fantastic job with everything” and that Custodio led a “very seamless process.” Wing’s commitment announcement design became one of Custodio’s first commissioned pieces.

Custodio’s design process varies depending on the post topic and with whom he works. Although the Wing piece took about an hour, some of Custodio’s edits are more time-consuming. Before starting a design, Custodio generally surfs Pinterest for inspiration. Once he has a rough idea of his design, he sketches. “I can play with ideas of what I'm gonna make without actually creating them,” says Custodio about these sketches.

Through his designs, Custodio gets to combine his love for sports and art. His favorite piece so far is a Charlie Haight ‘23 football card design that took six hours to produce. **Custodio channeled his childhood love of Pokemon cards and baseball cards to build a Prizm Independent School League (ISL) card that features Haight fiercely lining-up mid game and excitedly smiling post-game.** Custodio’s attention to detail is evident as the top of the card plays off the common practice of sports Card collection numbers with #055 — Haight’s Middlesex number.

Looking ahead to the winter season, Custodio plans to continue making posts for commitments, game days, and more. For now, it is safe to say that Gabe has indeed got it.
