Hannah Minifie always drew frequently as a kid and in high school. She was always good with her hands and crafting, which allowed her to take an interest in ceramics because everyone could appreciate her art. Yet in college, Minifie chose to double major in biology and art. Now, Minifie is the new ceramics and 3-D art teacher at Middlesex school.

Initially, Minifie believed she would be a scientist and often aspired to be a doctor or veterinarian. Still, she happened onto an art teaching job that ended up influencing her artistic interests. Through this experience, Minifie continued her teaching career and taught art at two other schools for six years.

She knew that art was a place where people could freely express themselves. Influenced by her dreams of being an artist, she quit teaching. After attaining her MFA at Boston University, she moved to Colorado for a year and took that time to grasp more opportunities as an artist. However, four months into creating art, Ms. Minifie realized how much she missed teaching and getting to know communities as she found it hard to meet people who had common interests in her daily life.

She knew community bonding was a natural component in an educational setting, so she decided to continue her teaching career and looked all over the United States to interview at schools in Ohio, Tennessee, Baltimore, and Massachusetts. Minifie especially took an interest in Middlesex because she loved the inclusive community and believed the school was a perfect chance for her to pursue her artistic goal of becoming a ceramics teacher.

As an artist, Minifie is interested in objects in our daily lives. She wrote a thesis on doors, focusing deeper on the interesting concept of seemingly ordinary objects. She thought about the functionality of doors, the craftsmanship of creating doors, and so much more. For instance, doors can separate two rooms but also assign power to people (for example, a door to the Headmaster’s Office).

Minifie found passion in creating art because, for her, art is not something people simply make for aesthetic purposes, but it is also a form of expression that incites creativity and calls people to think critically about the world. Now she is analyzing the meaning and representation of chairs and what they may signify for different people.

Even though Hannah Minifie started as a biology major, she realized her deep passion for art and her ability to creatively portray even the most minor and most ordinary things in ways that incite people to ponder them.
