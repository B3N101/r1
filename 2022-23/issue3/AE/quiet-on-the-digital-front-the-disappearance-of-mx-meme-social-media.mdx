A hallmark of Middlesex student culture has all but disappeared. The Middlesex meme pages, consisting of, _Nocontextmx, dankmx, mx varsity memes,_ and others, have all gone dark. Many faculty members don’t even know they ever existed––Ms. Marchand, for example, comments, “that does not ring a bell.” But, the students remember the accounts and the humor they used to engage with issues unique to Middlesex. 

Why did they die? **It seems unlikely that the school administration shut the accounts down because no faculty seem to have any memory of the meme accounts in the first place.** The most popular theory seems to be that the old owners of the accounts never passed them to younger students after graduating. Did the account owners not find anyone suitable to whom they could hand the accounts, or did they just forget to hand the accounts off? 

**Tanvi Khot ’23 feels as though “the funny people left,” and the end of the pages followed as simply as that.** The rest of the school was  ignored as inheritors because, as Khot puts it, “I don't think we are as funny as [the account owners] are.” A content creator for @_DankMX_ comments that they are still in the process of passing it on and remarks, "we didn’t really do anything with it” after graduating.

The accounts also clearly didn’t die from a lack of content or interactions. For example, Maddi Bayati ’23 says, “it brought a little giggle in the middle of the day.” And, the memes also brought the school closer together “because it was really jokes you had to be there for,” claims Ali Petrone ’23, rather than generic ones.

What about reviving the accounts? While all the students I talked to could quickly speak on their favorite memes––from the fruit chicken ones, to the ones about the musical, to the ones about the controversy with David Beare––students seem hesitant to answer whether or not to bring back the accounts. Some people were exuberant about the possibility of bringing the accounts back, while others were scared about the idea of someone messing up the iconic meme pages. 

Hopefully, someday soon, Middlesex will see the historic account _DankMX _make a comeback, so make sure to give them a follow so you can see that new content! But, if you cannot wait that long, many other new accounts now provide humorous MX content, such as “MX milk drinkers,” “MX salmon,” and “MX sleeping beauties.”
