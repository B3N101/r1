Every time a major event hits the news, complaints from constituents far and wide flood the congressional offices of Capitol Hill. But what happens on Congress’ end of these impassioned calls, and how do these complaints incite our representatives to take action? After spending the summer as an intern at New Hampshire Senator Jean Shaheen’s office, Cate Pitelli ‘20 provides a glimpse into the inner workings of a congressional office.

No two days are the same for a congressional intern; the workload depends on the fluctuant American political atmosphere. If Congress is in session, especially if there’s a heated ruling, it’s all hands on deck—vehement callers bombard the office with bitter tirades and harangues. **Cate herself recently received her first death threat over the phone, an alarming event which Cate believes has become a rite of passage among interns**. The political scene isn’t completely hopeless, though: interns like Cate log all legitimate, respectful comments for the Senator to review. She boils down any message, no matter the length or complexity, into a few succinct words.

When Congress isn’t in session, interns do behind-the scenes work. According to Cate, interns will take notes in briefings, record any appearances of their congressperson in the news, and work on research projects relating to their congressperson’s most prominent issues.

**Cate cited her Middlesex years as highly influential on her path to Capitol Hill.** She vividly recalls her time as a “bright eyed 14-year-old” freshman passionately discussing politics in the dining hall when former (and definitely dining hall debate-provoking) President Trump shocked the nation with his victory. These dining hall talks continued throughout her time at Middlesex, and, along with a little bit of seduction from the _West Wing_, they led her to study Political Science and Statistics at Worcester Polytechnic. Her continued interest led her to apply for this highly selective intern position.

Despite her passion, the job of a Capitol Hill intern is grueling. Dealing with rude and angry callers for long hours is emotionally exhausting and tedious. And Cate says that she is more than emotionally drained: the most unexpectedly challenging part of the job is the heat. Apparently the Founding Fathers did not consider swathes of sweat-soaked senators, interns, and everyone in between when deciding to place our nation’s capitol atop a swamp. Yet, even with its undeniable challenges, Cate finds her job to be extremely fulfilling. **She may be a “small part of the big picture,” but she is content in knowing that “the work that I do matters.”**

Cate also shared the inside scoop on how to best contact a representative. She advises sticking to a quality over quantity approach: if you contact your representative so frequently that your name embeds itself into interns’ gray matter, your concerns may stop being logged at all. And she recommends that every message gets straight to the point and does not try to address multiple issues at once, as these are often more meaningful when boiled down to a few words. Above all, Cate advocates for kindness—respect will always get a message farther than anger, especially if that anger is directed at the interns just because they are accessible scapegoats. And she advises sticking to your state’s representatives, as other congresspeople have zero obligation to hear you out. Even when contacting your own representative, Cate notes that an influx of criticism about an issue may make it a higher priority, but will not prompt a congressperson to simply change their opinion.

Finally, **Cate encourages others to use their congressperson’s resources if they need help from a federal agency.** Be it tax return troubles or green card delays, call if you need assistance: no matter the party, congressional offices have resources devoted to helping their constituents on federal matters.
