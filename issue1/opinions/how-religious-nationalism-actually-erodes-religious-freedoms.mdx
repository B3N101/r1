The idea of the separation of church and state was first proposed to limit governments’ bias towards or against various religions. Yet, as more and more politicians and organizations incorporate religion into politics, the freedom of religion suddenly starts to erode. When many politicians support one religion, people who practice other religions feel less safe, as they fear unjust manipulations of their religion by those in power.

	**If you practice a religion, it is inevitable that religion will affect how you vote and what you vote on. If you let your religion become the basis of your whole agenda or voting process, it becomes a problem**. In the past few decades, religious nationalism, and in particular, Christian nationalism has become prevalent in mainstream politics, especially since former President Trump entered the political arena. Since then, politicians, like Representative Majorie Taylor Greene and Representative Lauren Boebert, have openly supported the convergence of the church and state. Events such as the January 6th riot show the popularity and dangers of Christian nationalism.

	**Likewise, the Supreme Court has become more pro-religion with 83 percent of religion cases under Chief Justice John Roberts voting in favor of the religion, the highest in seven decades according to the _New York Times_**. Thus, many of these case rulings have allowed Christianity to gain more power and, in some cases, become intertwined with the state. When the state of Maine—which uses taxpayer money to fund students to attend private schools if they did not have schools near them—denied funding students at a religious school, the Court ruled with the families, thus forcing the state to fund these students’ education at religious schools in Carson v. Makin.

	The Court has benefitted Christian groups, in particular, ruling in favor of a Catholic social services agency in Philadelphia who refused to work with same-sex couples. Even though this refusal is discriminatory, and the recent Carson v. Makin decision erodes the separation of church and state, many people haven’t noticed these decisions or the prevalence of Christian nationalism in politics today. **Ultimately, if people are not aware that Christian nationalism is a huge issue of our time and do not fight back against it, the crisis will exacerbate.**

	One organization that is fighting against Christian nationalism is Christians Against Christian Nationalism, a group of over 25,000 Christians who believe that religious nationalism threatens their faith. Even though some values in religion hold value in society, it doesn’t mean that one religion should play a role in politics, and it definitely doesn’t mean that people should radically manipulate it.

	Ultimately, if religion continues to seep into politics, then religious minorities will feel unsafe and even lose their religious freedom entirely, eroding the First Amendment and the founding principles of the nation. However, most people-- 63 percent-- say that religion should stay out of political matters, according to Pew Research. As long as people start to understand that we need to solve this crisis, it is still possible to prevent a lasting blend of religion and politics.
