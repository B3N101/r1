Calling the ongoing heat wave a mere discomfort is an understatement. The intensity and enduring effects of high temperatures point not only to an unusually hot year, but to **a much worse picture of what the Earth could become as climate change persists.**

Extreme heat may be a sufferable and rather short-lived trouble now, but it will be a deadly normality for the future. The Weather Channel highlights that every state in the U.S. now has an all-time maximum temperature of at least 100 degrees, with the American Southwest temperatures nearing 130℉  (54.4℃). The vast majority of such temperature records, unsurprisingly, were set during the deadly heat wave this summer. Likewise, the heat wave shrouds most of Europe. Météo-France recorded a historic high of 114.6℉ (45.9℃) in southern France.

The apparent temperature index gives a most direct indication of what certain temperatures feel like to the human body. When humidity, perspiration, wind speed, and duration of exposure to heat are taken into account, 104℉ (40℃), the current threshold high temperature for many regions of the world, feels like 119 to 131℉ (48 to 55℃) under normal humidity. As a comparison, the common household dryer is only around 125 to 135℉ (52 to 57℃) when turned on medium to high heat.

Exposure to such extreme temperatures puts people in grave danger of heat exhaustion and life-threatening cases of heat strokes and hyperthermia. Other health risks include the exacerbation of existing health conditions, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular diseases. Empirical research published in _the Journal of the American Medical Association_ found that an increase in hot summer days of at least 90 ℉will lead to an average of 1,373 extra deaths each year.

One may try to avoid prolonged exposure to extreme heat, but that is not sustainable if the consequences of heat waves are “built-in” to where you live, according to _Lancet_. Around four billion people around the world live in urban areas. High population density, urban overcrowding, and concentration of greenhouse gasses are among many factors that intensify urban heat, making cities almost always hotter than rural areas.

In essence, living in an urban environment is a balance of pros and cons: exchanging one’s physical discomfort for economic gains, higher risks of health issues for proximity to medical resources, and wishing for the best when a disaster hits. **Soon, efforts to extinguish wildfires, conserve animals, and counter food shortages will prove futile, and many limitations that seem incongruous with our daily lives will _become_ our daily lives——unless we stop taking our environment for granted.**
