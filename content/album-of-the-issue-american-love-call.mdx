R&B/soul is one of the more underappreciated genres in the music scene. Although the genre is unable to garner the same mainstream presence as pop, country, and hip-hop, albums like _American Love Call_ by Durand Jones & the Indications beg the question of why R&B/soul is unable to attract a wider audience. 

In complete contrast to the last album of the issue, _American Love Call_ is loaded with soft ballads and peaceful instrumentation that make the listener feel as if they are being lifted into the clouds. The simple production creates an atmosphere of flight and serenity that pairs excellently with the wispy, high-pitched vocals of Durand Jones. This album, released in March of 2019, flows gracefully from song to song, as each track fits the spacey aesthetic perfectly while continuing to build upon the existential thoughts about love that Durand Jones seems to ponder throughout the record. 

Although it is difficult to pick out highlights on the album because of its overall consistency and the genius flow of the tracklist, “court of love” is an exceptionally beautiful listen that is easy to repeat constantly. The concept of a court of love is a new and exciting spin on the idea of love. Even though the lyrics are quite simple on this track and throughout the rest of the album, the concepts and ideas are relatively abstract while being grounded in easily accessible reality. Thus, the album's appeal is more in its pleasantly crafted instrumentation and Durand Jones’ uniquely soft and rich vocals. The smooth background vocals complement Durand Jones’ voice quite sweetly, and Jones’s vocal performance on his own is incredibly levitating.

Something important in albums that is disappearing in modern music is the chemistry of the songs on the tracklist. On this album, however, there are no moments on the album that stick out badly, which makes this listen particularly enjoyable; it all makes sense together. This album is a perfect example of a well-crafted mood where each moment pairs with the next in a way that truly works. 

Although _American Love Call_ is relatively simple, there are not many projects or tracklists that can successfully take such a simplistic sound and approach and turn it into something so uplifting and creative. Part of the symbolism of the simplicity of the work is its contrast to the complexity of love. **Durand Jones approaches this topic of love with an artfully whimsical approach that displays the spontaneity of the emotions of love**. Although the vibes of the songs are very similar, Durand Jones’s slow change in approach, going from a relatively pessimistic to a relatively optimistic outlook on love, displays how easily the presence of love in one’s life can change a person’s perspective on the value and authenticity of love.

As Durand Jones eventually realizes that love is what allows humans to feel such deep emotions of both happiness and despair, the album comes to its end and leaves the listener to think about the importance of love in their own life. Thus, this album is a great moment of pause and reflection. The themes are beautiful, and the concept is well executed. If you have not listened to much R&B/soul, this would be a great place to start, for its themes are consistent with the love-obsessive ideas that the genre tends to adhere to, and its instrumentation is as gracefully simple and charming.
