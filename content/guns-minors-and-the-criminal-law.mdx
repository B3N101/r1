Bang. From a gun a six-year-old is holding, a bullet flies through the air in the classroom at Richneck Elementary School, Newport News, Virginia. A teacher who was living, breathing, and talking seconds ago lies in a pool of her blood seconds later. Along with her are thousands of lives seriously injured due to gun violence in America.

Laws have attempted to restrict the right to bear arms. From the Bill of Rights—the brainchild of the founding fathers—to landmark decisions by the Supreme Court, the government has gradually limited the freedom of the American people to bear arms: defining lawful purpose of self-defense, limiting who are entitled to own and bear arms, and the issuing of firearm licenses by local police departments. Yet repeated instances of gun violence targeted at civilians call into question whether these restrictions work.

Imagine a scenario where two individuals are equals, but then one person displays his firearm to threaten or intimidate the other. Their power dynamics immediately change from a neutral relationship to an attacker-victim relationship, where, supposing that there is no outside intervention, the attacker has temporarily unlimited freedom at the cost of the victim who risks losing their life at any time.

Although the founding fathers intended for firearms to be a tool that secures freedom, they are weapons that give the bearer unlimited freedom by robbing the freedom and endangering the security of other people. **When held at gunpoint, what matters is not your freedom, but whether or not you lose your life.**

The unfortunate reality is that gun laws in America, although written clearly in terms of who is entitled to own firearms, slack off when it comes to enforcement. There is a clear gap between how government officials see guns and how their views are presented to the public, as well as between their intended and actual uses to perpetrate crimes. A Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2020 reveals that less than half of Americans (48%) see gun violence as a big problem today, while more than a quarter of Americans (28%) either see it as a small problem or not a problem at all.

Though laws cannot compel individuals to take a positive or negative stance towards something, effective laws respond to societal problems, raise awareness, and influence the public for the better. Simply looking at numbers, there certainly is a lot to be done on the part of law enforcement.

The January 6th shooting at Richneck Elementary School raises another concern regarding gun crimes: gun crimes that involve children. Should minors be tried as adults when they commit a criminal offense? The answer to this question is more complicated than it seems.

There have been numerous debates around whether children have the mental capacity to make fully conscious decisions. Children are influenced by their guardians, whose values inform the children's actions. Though we are not sure if the six-year-old’s shooting of his teacher was an accident and therefore cannot hold the child fully accountable for his actions, the fact that the boy brought a gun to an elementary school at least suggests oversight on the part of his parents.

Parents should act as a responsible guidance for their children. Laws cannot always cover all of the circumstances, but effective guidance could help reduce the unnecessary violence that troubles modern-day society.
