Laura, a resident of downtown Los Angeles who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or more commonly known as ADHD, says she ping-ponged between pharmacies trying to find any one with Adderall in stock. Recently, having gone a week without her medication, she suffered through the effects of an Adderall crash with symptoms such as panic attacks, depression, suicidal ideation, and sluggishness. She’s not alone. Adderall crash is now a common scene playing out as pharmacies nationwide struggle to restock. So just how bad is this shortage? What’s causing it? And what does this mean for both patients and wider society?

Adderall helps ADHD patients focus, because it increases levels of dopamine and noradrenaline, acting on the brain’s rewards center to make the individual more motivated towards a goal. This chemical increase, however, leads to the brain building reliance on the medication: the brain eventually produces less dopamine and noradrenaline naturally. The FDA thus classifies Adderall as “Controlled Substance With A High Potential For Abuse And Addiction.”

For months, a shortage of Adderall loomed over the country. A survey by the National Community Pharmacists Association conducted from July to August found that 64% of about 360 independent pharmacies were having difficulty obtaining Adderall. Then, on October 12th, 2022, the FDA declared a nationwide shortage of Adderall. According to the New York Times and NBC News, The straw that broke the camel’s back was labor shortage on the production lines of a major manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceuticals, but alarmingly, the long term reason for the Adderall shortages may have been over-prescriptions of the drug for abuse. Without question, more needs to be done to educate people on the risks of amphetamine abuse. 

**“People who take high doses of Adderall without a prescription can develop a tolerance for the drug, leading them to seek out more medication,” stated Dr. Harold Hong.**

According to IQVIA, a data analytics company, the number of Adderall prescriptions have risen from 35.5 million in 2019 to 41.2 million in 2021. In part, growing awareness of ADHD appears to be leading a surge in demand. However, a major reason for the recent sharp uptick in demand seen in the last few years is because of telehealth start-ups that make it easier to get an ADHD diagnosis and prescription for Adderall. Many of these start-ups are under scrutiny over the accuracy of their diagnoses: the major start-up Cerebral, for example, is under investigation by the department of justice over its procedures in prescribing controlled substances like Adderall.

“It’s abused more than marijuana and easier to get,” said Professor Alan DeSantis.

According to data published by the NIH, in a study conducted by professors and researchers of the University of Kentucky Alan DeSantis, 30% of students at the university have used an illegal stimulant like Adderall. This number increases to 50% of upperclassmen and 80% of upperclassmen in fraternities or sororities. Tellingly, students in the study believe Adderall is slightly more dangerous than Mountain Dew and nowhere as dangerous as drinking beer.

The patterns of Adderall usage today bring back memories of the opioid crisis of the 1960s, an article published on Psychology Today claims. Dr. David Sack argues that the societal belief in the harmlessness of Adderall and the massive amount of prescriptions by companies like Cerebral echo the “Dr. Feelgoods” of the 1960’s who prescribed amphetamines, the family of drugs Adderall belongs to, freely and indiscriminately. According to the NIH, the ongoing opioid pandemic in the United States has caused 70,237 overdose deaths in 2017 alone.

Of course, drug abuse isn’t the only reason for the current shortage. Because of the addictive nature of Adderall, government restrictions on the ability for manufacturers to increase output or for pharmacies to buy more of the medication may have exacerbated the shortage in this case.

For patients with ADHD - some 4 percent of adults and 8 percent of children - the effects of the Adderall shortage are painful. When patients’ medication is stopped abruptly, the symptoms of withdrawal include intense craving for more Adderall, anxiety and irritability, panic attacks, fatigue, unhappiness, depression, and suicidal thoughts.

Not all hope should be lost: the FDA expects the current acute shortage of Adderall to end by March 2023. Without more people knowing of the danger of Adderall abuse, however, long term implications that caused this shortage can only create worse consequences far into the future.
