Students have noticed the tone of chapel introductions change as Ms. Smedley, Middlesex’s Director of Spiritual and Ethical Education, has been reevaluating what the senior chapel talks mean at Middlesex.

In the past, the Senior Chapel intros became something of a flaunting of popularity. **The goal for this year’s chapel introductions is to remove that element of “popularity” and for the senior’s actual chapel talk to be the main focus.** Some seniors, as Ms. Smedley noted, might have “forty friends” sit at the front of the chapel and cheer them on, while others might have only “a couple” of friends—leading to many seniors having less confidence in giving their talks, simply because of the number of people sitting in the front row.

In the past, students have asked if they could throw candy, confetti, or dance in the Chapel as an intros before the talk. However, these behaviors do not reflect the dignified nature of the Chapel, and are perhaps more suitable for a Freedom of Speech performance. These activities have predated Ms. Smedley’s time at Middlesex, but she is ready to change the norm.

Yet, not having a “popularity”-focused chapel intro does not mean there is no room for fun; **recent senior chapel talks demonstrate how students are still allowed to be creative with their intros.** For example, at the first chapel talk of the year, delivered by Syd Cogliano ’23, her advisor, Karlyn McNall, read a rap by Kanye West to introduce the chapel. During Emma Poplyk’s ’23 chapel talk, fellow senior Chester Boynton ’23 read Dr. Seuss' book “Oh, the Things You Can Think!” as an intro. And while the rap and Dr. Seuss’s words were both fun, neither reading created an overly rambunctious environment in the chapel.

Ms. Smedley wants the Chapel to be a place where thoughtful activities take place, rather than outlandish acts that distract from the true purpose of it. While she believes that having fun is important, she doesn't want it to be too irreverent in the chapel setting. **When kids throw candy and confetti in the Chapel, it loses its quintessential formality and dignity—diminishing the transcendent effects that those unique 40 minutes of the week can have.**

Seniors’ opinions on the new policy are mixed. While some see the school’s perspective and understand how chapel talk intros can be sacrilegious, seniors also loved hearing personal anecdotes from previous seniors' lives. In a way, **seniors believe that the relaxed atmosphere brought the school together,** creating a place where students could enjoy more light-hearted stories. All of this former mood contrasts with the new style.

With new standards in place, Middlesex can look forward to experiencing seniors’ creativity to hold introductions for their chapels.
