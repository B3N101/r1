**1. Team USA sweeps men's sprinting podiums:** There is no doubt that the field of sprinters produced some major historical accomplishments. Team USA continued its sprinting excellence, as they achieved two extraordinary podium sweeps in both the men’s 100m and 200m finals.

**The last time the USA occupied all three steps of a World Championship 100m podium was back in 1991,** but all that changed in front of the ecstatic home crowd this year. Fred Kerley, who only dropped down to 100m in 2021 after competing in the 400m at the last Worlds, blazed to victory in 9.86 seconds to claim his first world title, with Marvin Bracy and Trayvon Bromell following close on his heels.

In the 200m, Noah Lyles smashed the previous 25-year-old American record held by Michael Johnson. With his sensational performance of 19.31 seconds, Lyles established himself as the third-fastest man in 200m history—right behind Yohan Blake and the legendary Usain Bolt.

**2. Is there anything stopping Sydney McLaughlin?** Yet again, USA’s Sydney McLaughlin broke her own world record in the women's 400m hurdles. After winning gold at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics in 2021, setting a new world record, the 22-year-old lowered that mark at the US Trials to qualify for Worlds. In front of a cheering home crowd, the American proved that she was in a race of her own by setting a new world record of 50.68 seconds, a full 0.73 seconds faster than her previous best. To put her incredible time in perspective, she would have finished seventh in the World Championships final of the women's 400m flat.

**3. Jakob Ingebrigtsen takes 5000m gold after 1500m disappointment:** Norwegian star, Jacob Ingebrigsten came into the championships as the reigning Olympic 1500m champion and was highly favored to double up on his victory in Tokyo with a gold in Eugene. However, things didn't go to plan: Great Britain's Jake Wightman sprung a surprise kick in the last 200 meters to take the world title, leaving the Norwegian in second—a big disappointment given the expectations he set on himself. But in the men’s 5000m, Ingebrigtsen aimed to leave no further regrets, surging to the front over the last lap before kicking home for a hugely impressive victory.

**4. Venezuela’s Queen of the Triple Jump, Yulimar Rojas:** Her third world title in a row saw Rojas once again in unbeatable form, as she leapt 15.47m to seal the victory, 0.58m further than her nearest challenger, Jamaica’s silver medal winner Shanieka Ricketts. Rojas, who is the reigning Olympic champion, still feels she has more to do in the sport as she takes aim at the mythical 16m mark. “It’s not the distance I wanted but I am happy,” Rojas said. “It has been a beautiful day, even if it hasn’t been my best day during the event.”

**5. Last but not least, USA's Track and Field legend, Allyson Felix bids farewell to the sport—and also with another gold medal around her neck:** After announcing she planned to retire at the end of this season, **the 36-year-old decided to race in one last World Championships to be in front of her home crowd in Oregon.**

Her final race was set to be the 4x400m mixed relay final at the start of the meet, where the USA placed bronze. However, after answering a mid-meet call to compete in the women's 4x400m, Allison, having already traveled home, hopped on a plane back to Eugene, Oregon. When her teammates claimed victory in Sunday's final, the USA legend added yet another gold—the 14th of her career— to her collection as part of the winning team at Hayward Field.

Unfortunately, these five highlights are only the tip of the iceberg and this article could not cover all the spectacular moments from Oregon, such as Mondo Duplantis’s world record in pole vault, Faith Kipyegon’s two-time world title in 1500m, and the Jamaican women’s sweep in the 100m lead by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. However, the 2022 World Athletics Championship signals a lively renewal for the sport after the pandemic.
