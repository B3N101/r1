As the 2022 FIFA World Cup comes to an end, we can only ponder how a tournament intended to unify all countries through the beautiful game of soccer has done quite the opposite. Undeniably, the FIFA World Cup is the world’s greatest game, as its influence brings fans from all across the globe to gather around and eagerly watch their respective countries battle to the end. All problems back at home are dropped, all grudges are sealed, and all international affairs seem to disappear as fans desperately support their teams in hope to see their country hoist the trophy. In the past, the FIFA World Cup has done just this, yet Qatar has failed to provide this sense of unification through its human rights abuses, homophobia, and corruption. What really happened in Qatar?

Even before the tournament officially began, the United States Department of Justice reported that Qatar had bribed FIFA to reward them as the host country, paying a large sum of money to host the World Cup in a country that was otherwise unfit for a game of soccer. Qatar, a desert country, frequently experiences dry temperatures as high as 110℉ during the summer, and thus paid FIFA to move the World Cup to the winter, where the climate was much more acceptable for an athlete’s body. Fans were enraged with this shift of the World Cup, claiming that it ruined the World Cup culture and put too much pressure on the athletes during what would have been their club season. 

FIFA never once addressed these claims of corruption clearly and continued to allow Qatar to host the World Cup. However, FIFA’s greatest mistake was leaving Qatar unchecked as they hired migrant workers to build their eight soccer stadiums. Qatar enrolled each migrant worker in the Kafala System, which effectively prevented them from leaving the country and forced harsh, unfair labor on the workers. Combined with the hot working environment of Qatar and the horrible living conditions, over 6500 migrant workers died before FIFA directly addressed this issue. 

As if these various abuses were not enough, Qatar does not recognize same-sex marriages or civil partnerships and even prevented teams from wearing the OneLove armband—a band to show their support to the LGBTQ+ community—during the games. The Washington Post reports that several Wales fans were forced to take off their LGBTQ+ shirts after being confronted by Qatari officials, and the argument nearly ended in violence after fans refused to remove their shirts. 

Yet very little media coverage has reported these abuses of Qatar and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Similar to the sausage theory, which states that people should never discover how the things they like are made, many enthusiastic fans turned a blind eye to Qatar because they simply wanted to watch the game without involvement in its controversies. Fans grudgingly accepted Qatar as the host country, freely sat in stadiums built on the backs of migrant workers, and ignored the unfair LGBTQ+ laws in Qatar. Even FIFA, despite firing multiple workers blamed for corruption, continues to deny any wrongdoing in the matter. Rather than simply pointing out corruption, action needs to be taken in order to ensure that a World Cup with this level of controversy never happens again.
