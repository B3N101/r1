On January 9th 2023, TCU’s magical Cinderella run to the College Football National Championship was brutally squandered by the undefeated 14-0 Georgia Bulldogs. The demoralizing massacre seemed to be foreshadowed from the beginning as TCU was called for a false start on the first snap of the game, despite only having three the whole season (Star Telegram). The drive failed to improve as they were stopped by Georgia’s defense on 4th & 12 and forced to punt. Georgia immediately countered with a 21 yard rushing touchdown from quarterback Stetson Bennet. On TCU’s next drive they fumbled at their own 35 yard line which led to a Georgia field goal to put them up 10-0. TCU responded with a touchdown of their own from their QB, Heisman runner-up Max Duggan, reducing the deficit to 10-7. Unfortunately for the Horned Frogs, this would be their only points of the game. **The rest of the game was dominated by the Bulldogs who put up an impressive 65 points and 589 yards to TCU’s 7 points and 188 yards**. Georgia’s commanding victory etched them in the history books as the first team to earn back-to-back national championships in the College Football Playoff (CFP) era. However, questions remain about TCU’s appearance. **How did a small Big-12 school make it to a contest heavily controlled by big SEC schools?**

Since 2014, the birth of the modern CFP era, SEC schools have won the National Championship six times, with the only exceptions being Ohio State and Clemson (NCAA). Additionally, college football fans are used to seeing powerhouses like Alabama, LSU, Georgia and Clemson in the championship which makes TCU’s appearance that much more unprecedented. Although TCU lost to Kansas State in the Big 12 Championship, their 12-0 regular season record was enough to carry them into the playoffs. Championship-regular Alabama was absent due to their two regular season losses to Tennessee and LSU, two top 25 teams. In the regular season TCU only played two top 25 teams, Texas and Kansas State. Alabama, however, played four top 25 teams in the regular season and Kansas St. in the Sugar Bowl, winning three of five ranked games (Alabama Football). TCU’s relatively easier regular season schedule could be responsible for their playoff bid; however, in a heated battle they put up 51 points and narrowly defeated third-ranked Michigan to earn their championship spot.

Deserving or not, TCU blames their utter collapse on lack of playoff experience: "A lot of these guys had never been to bowl games. Emotions might have gotten to them,” reflects Emari Demarcado, a senior running back (Star Telegram). Coach of the Year, Sonny Dykes, agreed: “I thought we were probably just a little too fired up, maybe a little too emotional. And as a result did some things that we don’t normally do. I just don’t think we were in the state of mind that we needed to be in” (Star Telegram).

Adding insult to injury, **Monday night was the lowest viewed National Championship game since 1999, as ESPN networks averaged only 17.2 million views.** The lack of interest was caused by viewers abandoning the game as it became lopsided so early in, as well as fewer people having cable due to the influx of streaming service options. To combat the insufficient interest, the CFP Board of Managers propose to expand the playoff bracket. Beginning in 2024 the CFP bracket will consist of 12 teams, which looks to benefit the SEC, which could hold up to seven spots. Furthermore, the Big 10 could also benefit from the move as the conference has consistently had multiple representatives in the top 12, but rarely has a team in the the final four (ESPN).

**The SEC remains supreme for now and in the foreseeable future with four teams predicted to be in the top ten next year** (ESPN). The SEC will likely be led by Georgia, heavily favored to win a three-peat next year with the exceptional defensive talent they are bringing in. Although TCU limps away from the National Championship in shame, they remain optimistic for the future. Despite a predicted 12th ranking next year, they hope to someday be on the same level as Alabama and Georgia.
