Lucas Mylon is no stranger to the Middlesex community. From starring on the track and field team to enlightening the student body in his senior chapel, Mylon has certainly left his mark on those around him.

However, Mylon has recently begun to make waves in sports photography and videography. Filming, editing, and photographing photos of Middlesex sports teams in the fall for the St. George’s Day hype video, he has brought a new light to the athletics scene at Middlesex.

Mylon’s interest in photography and videography began in an unusual way. In middle school, one of his favorite YouTubers did a camera giveaway, and Mylon was lucky enough to win the camera out of over 50,000 subscribers. Soon after, he began going out in his free time to take photos and explore his new camera, kickstarting his passion for camerawork. It wasn’t until high school that Mylon began to pursue his love for camerawork formally in photography classes during his sophomore year and in AP Photography as a senior—even dispensing his knowledge and continuing to practice as a co-head of the Photography Club.

This past fall, Mylon took a big step by creating his first video: the St. George’s Day hype video. With the departure of Wells Goltra ’22, who made St. George’s hype videos throughout his Middlesex career, Mylon stepped up to fill the big shoes Goltra left behind.

Mylon describes the process as very collaborative. Throughout the fall athletic season, he worked with Noah Pavlov ‘24, Tim Gachuki ‘23, Catherine Ripsteen ‘23, and Austin Lewis to film each sports team and compile the video. Mylon even incorporated his passion for photography into the video, as it included many still photos as well.

However, Mylon most enjoys the technical side of photography and videography. He says, “the actual science behind how cameras work and how you can adjust the settings is really interesting.”

There were challenges and successes for Mylon. He reflects that it was difficult for him and his teammates to find time to work together, as they couldn’t work together in the afternoons and often had conflicts in the evening. He also felt that the process included high pressure since the school would see the video. But, in the end, he thinks the video turned out well.

Although Mylon has developed an interest in videography, his passions still lie in photography. He feels that photography allows him to be more creative and leave a lasting impression. “A video can go by in a blur, but a photo lasts longer and is like freezing time. A single photo can also leave a lot to the imagination.”

Looking ahead, Mylon has no plans of stopping his passion for camerawork. He’s already beginning to work on the winter St. George’s hype video. In college, he also plans to pursue photography by taking some classes and continuing with sports photography.
