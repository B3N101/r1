Chester Boynton’s mastery of football is the result of years of dedication. Coming from a family of football enthusiasts and Patriots fans, Boynton began playing flag football from a young age. In sixth grade, he started playing for the Lincoln-Sudbury tackle football team, yet it was at Middlesex where Boynton began fully committing himself to the sport. Boynton said, “up until high school, I had always really preferred baseball. **But when I got to Middlesex, the complexity and intricacies of the game took a step up from middle school, and that’s when the game became more interesting and cerebral.**”

In particular, Boynton loves the emphasis that football puts on teamwork. “Football, more than anything, is a team game,” said Boynton. “It really requires everyone to know their part and do their job. It’s unlike any other sport I’ve ever played in that aspect. When a play is called, everybody has a certain job, and in order to execute the play, all eleven players on the field have to complete their job.”

Coming into Middlesex, Boynton saw himself as primarily a running back. Boynton recalled, “When I met coach Lang as an eighth grader preparing to come to Middlesex the next year, he told me he wanted a running back that was small and kind of built up my confidence, making me think I’d be making a big impact on the team as a freshman.” Since then, Boynton has taken on new roles and become a more versatile player. “The biggest way I’ve grown was to open myself up to new positions,” said Boynton. “I think I’ve played a total of five or six different positions over these past three years: linebacker, cornerback, safety, receiver, and running back.”

At Middlesex, Boynton has also amassed quite a few wins. Notable among them is his bowl game win against Canterbury in his freshman year. Boynton recalled, “that was a surreal experience that set the tone for what a good team looks like. The leadership on that team was really good; we had some great captains and some great seniors overall.” Boynton’s favorite memory is his last game from last season.** “It was coach Lang’s last game as head coach, and he was playing against his son, **and we were playing against our rival St. George’s. It was like a storybook ending–we won in overtime and it was just an amazing game.”

With new leadership this year, Boynton is excited for the coming season. “There’s a completely new team culture, and it’s a culture of excitement and possibility,” he said. “Coach Scott brought in some new coaches of his own, and [this change in leadership] has helped modernize our playbooks and strategies. It’s really refreshing for the program to take that next step.”

“This team really believes we can be something because we really believe in our coaches,” said Boynton. “We have some extremely qualified coaches, and I think the team has bought into that. And the coaches have bought into the team–they believe in us. And so there’s a lot of trust between the two. I think that’s really important.”

**However, drastic changes call for strong leadership, and as a captain, Boynton has taken on the role of guiding his younger teammates.** “We have a really young team, so the most important part is fostering that football culture and pulling everybody up to speed. You only get a couple of weeks before the first game of the season, and so that’s when teaching and leading by example is [especially] important.”

In the future, Boynton hopes to play either football or baseball in college.
