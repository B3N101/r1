From the opening match on November 20, 2022 up until the final on December 18, 2022, the world was completely immersed in the World Cup. In fact, the 2022 World Cup was the most viewed World Cup in history with over five billion total viewers, and the final itself astonishingly had approximately 1.5 billion viewers. The tumultuous game of football or soccer, here in the United States, captured significant and global attention through the stories which developed over the course of the tournament – stories of upsets, legacy, and disappointment.

The 2022 World Cup enjoyed some of the greatest upsets in World Cup and sports history. Standing out is the group-stage match between Argentina and Saudi Arabia; Argentina, one of the most successful footballing nations in the world, who had a 36-match unbeaten run coming into the matchup, was a true Goliath compared to Saudi Arabia, a nation that was ranked 48 places behind Argentina according to FIFA’s national team rankings. Yet Saudi Arabia, to the surprise of the world, came out on top after scoring two goals following Argentina’s first strike. Saudi Arabia’s victory was such a shock that the country enjoyed a national holiday in celebration of their group-stage victory and has been acknowledged as the greatest World Cup upset of all time.

Not only did the 2022 World Cup enjoy the greatest upset of all time, but it also enjoyed many other group-stage upsets. Japan beat the odds to defeat Germany in a 1-0 victory that eventually led to Germany’s early exit from the tournament for the second time in a row. Also in the group stage, Australia landed a spot in the knockout stage with a 1-0 victory and upset over Denmark. The victory was a massive World Cup shock as Denmark was predicted to be one of the World Cup’s dark horses following their performances in Euro 2020, where the team reached the semi-finals of the competition. Additionally, Belgium was a team that completely broke down in the competition, succumbing to internal squad issues as they failed to enter the knockout stage following a draw against Croatia and a miserable loss against the underdogs Morocco.

Morocco was the shining star of the tournament. Morocco not only shined in the group stage, but also made history in the knockout stage where they defeated Spain in the round of 16, defeated Portugal 1-0 in the quarterfinals which was, notably, Cristiano Ronaldo’s final World Cup match, and subsequently became the first African nation to reach the semifinals of a World Cup. They ultimately lost to France in the semis.

The road to the finals was intense. Neymar, though absent from parts of the tournament, led Brazil up to the quarterfinals, where his extra time, tiebreaking goal was futile as Croatia tied the game up in the last minutes and won it in penalties. Croatia pushed forward, losing to Argentina in a tough semifinal match, yet winning against Morocco in the consolation match, cementing its status as a leading football nation with two World Cup medals, one win and one third place, in the past two World Cups. England, who showed their strength throughout the tournament, highlighted by their 6-2 win against Iran, were led by a star-studded core consisting of Bukayo Saka, Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, and Marcus Rashford. However, they faced a disappointing, and all too familiar, end to a major tournament, where they lost to France 2-1 in the quarterfinals after a missed a penalty cost them the game.

The road was ultimately set for a finals matchup of the ages: France versus Argentina.  The defending champions against the challenging titan. Mbappe versus Messi. And the match did not disappoint. In the first half, Argentina scored twice with Messi scoring first with a penalty and Di Maria scoring second on a counterattack. In the second half, Mbappe had a historic performance where in a matter of minutes he scored two goals, including an utterly insane volley, to tie the match up. The game subsequently entered extra time where Messi scored his second followed by Mbappe’s third, which ultimately led the game into a penalty shootout where Argentina came out on top as Emi Martinez displayed himself as one of the greatest World Cup goalkeepers of all time.

Overall, the 2022 FIFA World Cup was a historic success. It included viewership records, historic matchups, and legacy-defining moments, and it truly displayed what the World Cup and football as a sport are all about.
