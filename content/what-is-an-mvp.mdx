With the NBA regular season more than halfway through and the NFL playoffs coming to a close, let’s take a look at some of the most likely MVP candidates in each league as of midway through January. Keep in mind that both of these awards are decided by a panel of voters based on the regular season only, so an amazing playoff run will not help a dark horse candidate win.

In the NFL, the MVP trophy has come to be widely regarded as “the quarterback award”; in the past 17 years, only two non-QBs have been awarded the most prestigious title in professional football: LaDainian Tomlinson and Adrian Peterson––both running backs. Thus, it has become pointless to even consider any other player as a candidate. HOWEVER, since I am a pointless man, I will make a short but pointless argument. Much like Marcus Smart being the first guard to win the NBA Defensive Player of the Year since Gary Payton, **I think this is the voters’ last chance to push back against the common conception that only a quarterback can win MVP**. And the recipient: Justin Jefferson.

Though Jefferson just barely missed the single-season receiving record, he was prolific for the entire year and accounted for nearly 40% of his quarterback’s passing yardage, bringing in over 1000 more yards in the air than anyone else on his team. If he had broken the record, I believe he might have had a legitimate shot at the MVP, but I doubt Jefferson will bring home the hardware this year. However, he has certainly proven himself as one of the top receivers in the league, and is quickly building a foundation for a Hall of Fame career.

Now we arrive at my clear-cut favorite for the award this season. Given that it is a QB trophy and all that, I think the only possible choice is Patrick Mahomes. Leading the league in pass yards by a 500-yard margin, with six more TDs than anyone else, the best passer rating of all eligible players, and a tidy 14-3 record to round it out, he has been far and away the best quarterback in the league. Of course, having Travis Kelce and a very competent wide receiver lineup helps, but nobody can deny Mahomes’ dominance. He may well end up as the greatest player in league history if he gets a few more rings for his resume.

**The NBA MVP race is much tighter, and it seems nobody can agree on a leading candidate**. If you consider the MVP to be the best player on the best team, Jayson Tatum of our own Boston Celtics is the man. With a league-best 33-12 record and averages of 31 points, eight rebounds and four assists, as of writing, JT has been the premier two-way superstar since opening night. Though a bit streaky, he’s now entering the period in which he commonly smooths out and dominates for long stretches, so he should strengthen his bid for the newly-named Michael Jordan MVP Award.

However, if the stat-heads have anything to say about it, one of two alternative options will be lifting the crystal trophy in June. Averaging a ridiculous 34 points, nine rebound and nine assists (on a whopping 37% usage rate), as of writing, Luka Doncic has finally dragged the Dallas Mavericks to a playoff chance and shows no signs of slowing down. The 23-year-old Slovenian phenom recorded a 60 point, 20 rebound, 10 assist triple-double against the Knicks, which has never been done before. If he keeps producing at this pace, he will win not only MVPs but likely enter into many fans’ top five players of all time.

800 miles away, Denver’s seven-foot point-center Nikola Jokic continues to pick defenses apart with his ridiculous vision and unstoppable scoring. Two straight MVPs seem unsatisfactory for the Serbian superman; his averages of 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists, all while making a mind boggling 62% of all shots, as of writing, have him performing at a career high level. Sadly, the infamous “voter fatigue” may hold Jokic back from being the first player since Larry Bird to win three straight MVP awards.

So who will take home this year’s MVP award in the NFL and NBA? We’ll just have to wait to find out.
