The date is November 25th. David Pastrnak just buried a missile of a one-timer past Carolina Hurricanes’ goalie Pyotr Kochetkov in overtime to send the Bruins to their 12th straight victory on home ice, breaking the previous NHL record of 11 consecutive home wins to start a season. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown put up 30 and 25 points, respectively, as they cruised to a 122-104 win over the Sacramento Kings, leading the Celtics to the top of the NBA standings at 15-4. As the month of November drew to a close, both the Bruins and Celtics would continue to dominate, ending with an unbelievable 16-0 combined record at TD Garden. But for an aging team with its championship window closing fast and another still suffering a devastating Finals loss just six months ago, how did the Bruins and Celtics get here?

Well, no one expected this from the Bruins. After the departure of former head coach Bruce Cassidy in early June, it is clear that new head coach Jim Montgomery has had a big impact on this Bruins team. Prioritizing a “we” culture along with a more up-tempo system, **Montgomery is a big factor in the Bruins’ confidence and production this season.** As of mid November, the Bruins were ranked as the second-highest scoring team in the league with 56 goals and fifth in 5-on-5 goals-for percentage (58.62), while also outscoring opponents 10-1 in the third period and ranking first in third-period goal differential (plus-14). It also doesn’t hurt to have a legit Vezina Trophy Candidate (best goalie) on the team in Linus Ullmark, who, as of November 11th, ranked first among all goalies in wins (10) and second in goals-against average (1.95). With superstar defenseman Charlie McAvoy out until late November, Hampus Lindholm, the defenseman acquired from Anaheim last March, has stepped up into a big role this season, ranking fifth among all blueliners in points (14) while also heavily contributing to Boston’s league-best penalty kill. **With Pastrnak’s looming contract up after the year, along with aging veterans, Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci, could this be Boston’s last chance to win it all?** Anyways, the team looks to welcome the injured superstar Brad Marchand along with McAvoy back into the lineup as the Bruins seek their seventh Stanley Cup in franchise history under Montgomery’s coaching and Patrice Bergeron’s leadership in what could quite possibly be their Last Dance.

Before the NBA season started, it was fair to say that there were some concerns around the Celtics after the suspension of former coach Ime Udoka. With interim head coach Joe Mazzulla taking the reins, would this Celtics team even be the same? After getting bounced in Game Six of the 2022 NBA Finals to the Warriors last year, **it was clear the Celtics started this season with something to prove**, regardless of who their head coach was. After adding Malcolm Brogdon in the offseason, this Celtics’ roster screams with talent and depth. **Joe Mazzulla has his team firing on all cylinders**, going 9-0 at home in the month of November, while averaging a ridiculous 120.4 points per game (1st in the NBA) along with a plus-7.1 point differential, almost two full points ahead of the next closest team. The two budding superstars, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, have put up incredible production. Tatum, an early MVP candidate, is averaging over 30 points per game and finished the month of November with 9 30+ point performances, just one shy of Larry Bird’s 10 in 1986. With Jaylen Brown similarly averaging over 25 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, it's easy to see how the Celtics have succeeded early on this season under the veteran leadership of Marcus Smart and Al Horford.

Though both teams have started out the year hot, neither team has won a championship in recent history. By mid June, it’s more than possible that yet another banner is added to the rafters in a city accustomed to championship success.
