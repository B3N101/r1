Emma says her favorite part of being a high school athlete is the close-knit community of the teams. In high school, the skill level on a given team, especially Middlesex’s field hockey team, varies from people like Emma who are continuing their sport in college to people who just picked up a stick. Coming in second in the ISL last year, the field hockey team is notorious on campus for being a “cult,” but Emma likes to think of it as a family.

Emma’s greatest high school athletic achievement thus far was being a part of the Middlesex varsity field hockey team that finished second in the ISL Class B league. With a hard-fought season consisting of many ups and downs, **the Middlesex field hockey team made it to the playoffs, coming in as the number one seed.** Easily defeating their first opponent in the playoffs, Emma and the team went on to round two, where they won a tough game against Thayer. Their final game against Brooks, however, ended in a disappointing defeat. Despite not getting the outcome they wanted, Emma and the team left the game with their heads held high, proud of their 16-4-1 record.

In addition to field hockey, Emma plays on the girls’ varsity lacrosse team, which came in third in the ISL this past year, where she starts as a defender. Also, Emma played varsity basketball as a freshman and sophomore, making her a tri-varsity athlete freshman and sophomore year. But junior year, Emma quit the varsity basketball team to focus on her field hockey career, which she is continuing at Columbia University.

Emma’s advice is for future Middlesex athletes to enjoy their time as much as possible. She says the teammates you meet in high school will be some of your lifelong best friends, so you should enjoy the time you get to play on teams with them as much as possible because four years go by in a flash. Another piece of advice Emma gives is to set a goal for yourself and stop at nothing to achieve this goal. **When Emma was younger, her goal was to play Division One field hockey at a stellar academic school.** Emma worked hard in relentless pursuit of this goal. She never gave up, and as a result, is playing D1 field hockey at an Ivy League university.
