Imagine waking up to a quiet campus without the hustle and bustle of a regular day: no students hurriedly dash across the circle to class, no cheers come from the sidelines, and there is no looming stress about busy upcoming schedules. **This is no remote vacation resort—this is Middlesex during the fall long weekend and family weekend.**

While many students are enjoying time with their family and friends at home, many non-local students are left with no opportunities for a weekend escape. "Being an international student is a bittersweet experience," says Amelia Deng ’25, a sophomore boarding student from Shanghai, China, as she reflects on her experience last year—her first year studying in the United States. "The greatest challenge for me and my family is the great distance that separates us."

As COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts steadily drop since the beginning of this year, air travel to Boston is gradually becoming a promising possibility for parents to visit campus, attend classes, communicate face-to-face with teachers, and watch games. While such a visit may not be an option for many international students’ families for three-day long weekends, the upcoming Thanksgiving and Winter Break are more appealing options due to their longer duration.

Nevertheless, the fall long weekend is a perfect time to take some time off and enjoy the campus with which we are both familiar and unfamiliar. Every day, as we hurry from one building to another, we rush past scenes that we oftentimes take for granted: the changing colors of leaves, the serene waves on Bateman’s pond, the sounds of acorns dropping onto the ground, the blooming hydrangeas and daisies, and so much more.

“One of my favorite activities during the long weekend is going on woods walks. **It is a surreal experience: it is almost as if time has slowed down and stopped as I traverse the Estabrook woods, stepping on the crunching autumn leaves,**” says Teddy Stevens ’24, a junior boarder in Atkins. Teddy's parents don't usually come for the long weekend because they live far away, but he enjoys the peacefulness around campus as well as spending time with friends, feeling free from pressure and anxiety.

In addition to a much-treasured tranquility on campus, this year during fall long weekend and family weekend, Middlesex offered various activities to students, including trips to Halloween-themed parks, movies, malls, grocery stores, the New England Aquarium, and Harvard Square. To make international students feel more at home, Flik dining at Middlesex prepared Asian dishes such as Japchae (Korean stir-fry glass noodles) and spicy rice cakes for students staying on campus.

“Long weekend and family weekend were much more fulfilling this year, thanks to the students, faculty, and staff's collective efforts to build an inclusive environment," praised Eric Nie ’24. Eric, a junior from Chengdu, China, is the founder and co-head of the International Students Association at Middlesex, a student-led affinity group that provides resources and accommodations for international students and families. Eric looks forward to continuing the Association’s collaboration with the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Office and the MX Global Program. He comments, "**connections create a sense of belonging over time, the feeling that one belongs to their identity, culture, and the Middlesex community.**"
