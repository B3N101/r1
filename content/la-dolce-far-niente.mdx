You’re in an orange grove, letting the sun fade at the horizon. Trees hang over you, and the wind hits you softly. You gaze at the folks around and see an older couple holding hands on the bench from across. A family strolls by, and you smile as a little toddler holds his baby sister. Hurriedly passing them is a young man wearing a suit and new shoes. You take a nap.

Watching the sky, the night has arrived. And as you glance at your watch for the first time, you realize that time moves as slow as honey.

The Florentines call it _Dolce Far Niente_, a phrase which translates to the sweetness of doing nothing. And though doing nothing may seem counterproductive or perhaps disruptive to our fast-paced lives, I endorse it. The concept of _Dolce Far Niente_ can actually make you smarter and happier.

Allowing yourself to perform tasks that require minimal attention can increase your mental capacity. **Beyond the nightly eight hours, some doctors recommend cognitive rest during the daytime**. In the Default Mode Network (DMN), also known as the unfocus network, your brain is capable of retrieving memories and linking ideas, two functions that are essential to the long term development of the brain and beneficial for shorter term necessities. Thus, during the school year, take frequent breaks when you study. Though you will not know it instantaneously, trust that your brain will work its magic, retaining the new math or language concepts you have learned. Likewise, you’ll make connections across History and English class, allowing you to excel as a writer and thinker. Without intentional work, I promise that your grades will improve.

Throughout life, you will realize that the simple moments make you happiest. Sometimes, just sitting outside watching people is the best thing you can do to make you smile. Or perhaps this type of moment for you is watching the sky, taking a shower, or enjoying a glass of lemonade. Somehow, when you are not actively doing something, the sensory experiences enchant you with a distinct joy while you absorb everything. Gratitude takes over you, and you are simply happy to be. I firmly believe that the monotony of our routines and schedules should be replaced by a myriad of these remarkably simple moments. If you are with the people you love, in your favorite place, savoring your favorite delicacy, even doing nothing will allow you to enjoy what really matters to you.

Lastly, there are some customs that I do recommend following. For instance, in larger Italian city centers, there is something called _aperitivo_ time. It is when, in the late afternoon before dinner, everyone goes out to a bar to have a drink (or a mocktail) and a little snack: it is a time to reset and relax before dinner. Likewise, before dinner, **there is also something called a _passagieta_, more common in rural Italian towns, in which a family goes out for a walk.** During the _passagieta_, individuals exercise and socialize. Perhaps most representative of the _Dolce Far Niente_ is the Spanish siesta, a time after lunch when everyone from store owners to business people goes home to take an afternoon nap.

These three customs take place in the afternoon, during the peak of the sun when it is warmest. But why wait till then? The peak of the moment is now, so I say find your orange grove and watch your sunsets. Don’t do anything— you’ll live a little.
