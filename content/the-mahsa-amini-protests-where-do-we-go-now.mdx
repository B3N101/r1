On September 13, 2022, a young Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini was arrested for wearing an inappropriate hijab. According to her family and eyewitnesses detained with her, she was so violently beaten by the morality police that she fell into a coma. She passed away in a Tehran hospital two days later.

Iran erupted in shock, revulsion, horror. And the people took to the streets: first outside of Kasra Hospital, then in Amini’s hometown of Saqez, soon after in the provincial capital of Sananday. By September 20th, the nation was rocked by protests in at least 16 of its 31 provinces. As young women in Tehran, Mashhad, and Isfahan burned their hijabs and cut their hair, **the words on Amini’s tombstone became their rallying cry: “Beloved Žina [Mahsa], you will not die. Your name will become a code [rallying call].”**

Unfortunately, we’ve all seen this before. Past mass protests of outrage in Iran, United States, China — anywhere really. And yet, despite injustices one after another, no one knows how to move forward.

It’s been 120 days since Mahsa Amini was arrested and murdered. The outside world watches as the Iran protests march onwards, unrelenting. Iran has gone so far as to open fire and kill 67 protesters in Zahedan, lay siege on Sharif University, and detain hundreds of protesting children in “psychological centers” without their parents’ knowledge.

Iran’s most powerful domestic weapon is its ability to execute its citizens. In doing so, the state aims to frighten the protesters into silence. From outside its borders, we watched in alarm as the state’s security forces gunned down protesters—525, to be exact. And it seems to the government that this isn’t enough. Thus, Iran resorts to a familiar scheme: in swift sham trials, where security forces exert de-facto control over judges, courts across the country sentence protesters to death.

On December 8th, 2022, 23-year-old Mohsen Shekari’s execution by hanging marked the first judicially ordered murder of a Mahsa Amnini protester. That same day, Amnesty International warned that a senior Iranian police commander had signed a document requesting the public execution of a prisoner connected with the protests "as a heart-warming gesture towards the security forces." **Three days later, Iran hanged 23-year old Majidreza Rahnavard in a public square in Mashhad. The Iranian judiciary posted pictures of his body hanging from the cable of a construction crane**.

Following the third and fourth executions of Mahsa Amini protesters on January 7th, January 8th saw twenty-five protests across seventeen cities, the largest in scale since December 5th. On January 9th, hundreds gathered at the [Rajai-shahr Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajayi-shahr_Prison) in [Karaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaj) to protest the transfer of two more protesters to solitary confinement before their scheduled executions. However, signs emerge of the protests quieting: fewer public demonstrations have been held, though the Campaign for Human Rights in Iran assures that protests are “Protests have taken a different shape, but not ended.”

Undoubtedly, the protesters have been extraordinarily resilient. But here, we stand at a crossroad. Expecting regime change is unrealistic: though many young Iranians have bravely taken to the streets, fuelled by legitimate grievances against an oppressive state, the Iranian government shows little sign of fracturing. Throughout the protests, the government has been cohesive and unified in carrying out its cruelty; Iran’s armed forces, increased in size since the green movement and practiced at putting down dissent, are much greater than the scope of the protests. So where do we go now?

For reference, we can look to the renowned political scientist Hossein Bashiriyeh’s general model for thinking about how any “revolutionary situation” can develop. Totalitarian governments respond to dissent by either clamping down even harder or turning to appeasing policies, such as expanding social services. It’s important also to consider that Iran experienced major protests in 2009, 2017 to 2018, and 2019: unless the authorities respond to the underlying reasons for protest, it’s just a matter of time before the next one begins once again.

In the end, maybe Iran will drastically militarize further and clamp down on the limited civil liberties left, brutally quashing the population’s ability to protest. Or maybe Iran will attempt to appease its population, though sanctions have drained the state’s ability and desire to deliver public services. Or, maybe, Iran continues on its current course of punishing the protesters, and regardless of whether the Mahsa Amini protests continue on, the future protests destined to take its place could one day lead to change in the Islamic republic. Only time will tell.
