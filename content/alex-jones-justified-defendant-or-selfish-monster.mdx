On October 12th, Alex Jones was ordered to compensate the families of victims from the Sandy Hook shooting with almost $1 billion. Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist and far-right radio show host, whose wildly unfounded claims have inflicted great pain on his targeted victims. Following the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting that occurred in 2012, Jones falsely claimed on his Infowars show that the massacre was just a government plot to enact gun control and that the families of victims were employed actors. He distorted the story of the shooting, twisting it into one of his baseless and ill-conceived theories. Many families, such as the Parkers, whose daughter Emilie died in the shooting, have received rape and death threats from Jones’ fervent followers as a result of his groundless accusations, and Jones’ fans have even threatened to defile and dig up the victims’ graves. Jones constantly singled out Robbie Parker, Emilie’s dad, on Infowars after Parker made a televised tribute to his daughter after her death. Mr. Parker originally refused to join the Jones case because he didn’t want to exacerbate the harassment that he and his wife had received. He finally joined in 2018, telling the jury how he and his family have suffered at the hands of Jones and his followers.

**“Every day in that courtroom, we got up on the stand and we told the truth. Telling the truth shouldn’t be so hard, and it shouldn’t be so scary.”**

Alex Jones responded to the trial with a lack of guilt and remorse for causing pain to the victims’ families, stating that he was “actually proud to be under this level of attack.” He defiantly claimed that the lawsuits are the government’s attempt to silence him, seeking an appeal and refusing to accept the verdict. Declaring his company, Free Speech Systems, bankrupt, Jones argued that he could not pay the one billion dollar compensation. In his testimony, Jones claimed that **“they [, the government,] covered up what really happened, and now I’m the devil.”**

This court case makes many people wonder: to what extent does freedom of speech exist? Freedom of speech does technically exist, as anyone can say anything they want. Yet, words have consequences, and sometimes they create irreparable damages. In the Alex Jones trial, he and his fans inflicted pain on the grieving families through their verbal harassment. His talk on Infowars caused so much harm to the families, especially the Parkers, that Mr. Parker and his wife were terrified that Jones’ fans would disrupt Emilie’s funeral service. Jones clearly said everything he wanted to, but his words cost him $1 billion and made people’s lives miserable.

The lawyers on the families’ legal team have commented on Jones’ verbal harassment. The families’ persecution lawyer stated, **“his attack on these families has been a de-humanizing attack.”**

People in places of power have lots of influence, especially with the existence of social media and the internet. Celebrities with a substantial amount of followers, such as Alex Jones can leave a tremendous impact on their audience. Jones’ avid fans rushed to support his views, and his unfounded claims caused his fans to target the grieving families. There are many tragic cases where social media has proven to possess a dangerous amount of influence on people. An example of this would be a mob killing in India in 2018 when people were misled and misinformed through Whatsapp, resulting in countless gruesome casualties. People in power, especially through the vast social media network, can influence people at a truly frightening magnitude.

Jones also continuously exploited the Sandy Hook story to maximize his product and audience sales for personal benefits. Lawyers investigated Jones’ financial records, and they show that he is not bankrupt. He still earns a steady flow of money, with added donations from his dedicated fans. In some periods in 2018, Infowars made more than $800,000 a day, and even though it has been years since Jones was de-platformed, he still earns almost $4 million in a week. Jones’ abundant income shows that he is able to compensate the families, yet, he just refuses to admit how he has tormented the families of the Sandy Hook victims for years. It is my belief that Jones’ appeal is not justified, because he apathetically piled onto the trauma that the families of victims already had while they were grieving for the deceased children, solely for his own financial gain.
