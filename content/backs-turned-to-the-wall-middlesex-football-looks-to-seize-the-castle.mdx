CONCORD, Massachusetts—The Middlesex Football team is struggling. The Zebras currently stand at only 20 points scored and 63 points allowed with an 0-3 record. And now, the star running back Bo Bensley ‘23 is out with a broken hand and has no current return timetable. Many teams would consider the season a wash and one doomed to fail—but not the resilient Zebras.

In response to the Zebras’ 13-20 loss to St. Mark's starting quarterback Ty Fein ‘24 did not shy away from stating that “we almost beat ourselves.” Although Fein added that the offense lacked efficiency and could not convert in the endzone, he remained optimistic for the future, emphasizing that “we need to win out to have a chance.”

Outside linebacker TJ Kane ‘25 claimed that the team was “pretty disappointed” following the loss. “We thought that was a surefire win,” said Kane. Kane provided insight into the emotions of the team after the game, highlighting the “quiet bus ride back.”

Still, with the loss at the front of Kane’s mind, he interrupted the interview to call attention to a stellar performance from kicker Hayden Girolamo ‘23. Kane emphasized that “not only did [Girolamo] do a great job kicking, but he was an anchorman on the defense [who] made some really key tackles and some sacks. He balled out on Saturday.” 

Finishing the game against St. Mark’s 2/2 on field goals and 1/1 on extra points, Girolamo remained humble. “Kicking is all confidence,” said Girolamo, rejecting any notion of skill. Quickly returning to a team mindset, Girolamo stressed, “We gotta work better together.”

Echoing the words of his teammates, lineman Gabe Custodio ‘23 added that “we were making a lot of little mistakes, and those little mistakes add up over time.”

Kane, Custodio, and Girolamo agreed that the team simply “couldn’t finish” against St. Mark’s.

Leaving St. Mark’s behind, the Zebras looked ahead to the opposing Zebras—Groton.

Heading into their critical match-up against the 0-2 Groton, Fein held his head high and looked to their week of preparation with a positive outlook. Claiming that in response to the straight losses, “Coach [Scott] has really adjusted the way we go through the week.”

However, even the Zebras' valiant efforts appeared not to be enough to stop the Groton team. Letting through 26 points, 74 passing yards, and 174 rushing yards to Groton, the Zebras could only generate 95 total yards of offense, with 116 yards coming through the air and -21 yards in the ground game.

Star running back Bo Bensley ‘23 broke his hand in the first quarter of play against Groton. Now without a key part of their offense, the Zebras will need to adjust their offensive game plan for the foreseeable future. It is currently unclear when or if Bensley will return to action this season. 

Despite the ambiguity surrounding the direction of the Zebras' season, Fein made one thing clear to the Middlesex Herd: “people are hungry to get a win.” With the strong Noble and Greenough Bulldogs patiently waiting to defend their castle from the stampeding Zebras, the Zebras will need to play their best football yet.

The Anvil will continue to follow the Zebras in their first year under Coach Scott and their road to win out for the remainder of the season—with the playoffs now hanging in the balance.
