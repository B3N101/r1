On June 24th, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned _Roe v. Wade_, the 1973 landmark ruling that recognized the constitutional right to abortion in the United States. Following the reversal, states now have the power to establish their own abortion laws. **Currently, half of the states have banned abortion, are expecting to ban abortion, or have gestational bans, while a handful of states are looking to decide on their status of abortion.**

Many states with anti-abortion legislators established “trigger bans” in anticipation of the strike down of _Roe_. For example, Kentucky, Louisiana, and South Dakota passed trigger bans that went into effect immediately after the fall of _Roe_, while other states, like Texas and Tennessee, had similar bans that would go into effect 30 days after the strikedown of _Roe_. 

Furthermore, several states, such as Mississippi, Wisconsin, and North Carolina, still have decades-old abortion bans written into their laws. These states could retrogress to a pre-Roe environment if state officials seek to reactivate those laws.

**Meanwhile, other states have passed laws to protect abortions.** Connecticut has approved House Bill 5414 to protect residents and providers from out-of-state penalties and to expand the kinds of medical staff who are allowed to perform abortions. People or organizations in Connecticut who are sued for any involvement in abortions in other states can countersue for damages. The law passed the House of Representatives in May and went into effect on July 1st. Additionally, other states including Colorado and New Jersey have recently enshrined abortion rights into formal state law.

Abortion protection organizations have also spoken up about the Supreme Court’s ruling. **Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit organization for sexual and reproductive health care, released a statement criticizing the overturn.** The organization addressed its patients, saying “we know you may be feeling a lot of things right now– hurt, anger, confusion. We’re here with you– and we’ll never stop fighting for you.” The president of Planned Parenthood, Alexis Johnson, also emphasized that the effects of the decision reverberate especially among racial minorities, people with disabilities, immigrants, and low-income Americans. 

The overturn of _Roe_ also has implications in the corporate world. Many companies now have to decide whether or not, and how, to provide abortion access to employees that live in states where abortion is now illegal. Large companies such as Apple, Disney, and CVS Health already cover travel to states for abortion access. Other companies like Dick’s Sporting Goods, have changed their medical benefits to provide employment benefits for those looking for out-of-state reproductive healthcare. These companies now need to reimburse travel expenses and protect employees’ privacy. However, a large majority of companies have not commented publicly about the ruling and the effects of it on their employees’ healthcare. 

In recent years, a few companies have spoken up about similarly polarizing issues, such as the Black Lives Matter movement following George Floyd’s murder. However, in the case of abortion, companies are forced to react through the decisions they make with abortion coverage in their employment healthcare. The overturn of _Roe _may affect where companies are located, what political organizations or lawmakers they support and donate to, and how companies communicate with current and future customers and employees. 

More importantly, the Supreme Court’s decision has and will continue to affect the lives of millions, as many are stripped of their rights to control their own reproduction, health, and consequent course of life. Racial minorities and those with low-income are especially affected by the overturn, as they have limited access to health care and less financial resources. **In other words, the overturn of _Roe_ will only further the current disparities in sexual and reproductive healthcare between socio-economic statuses. In any case, the increasingly restricted access to safe abortions will increase the number of unsafe, or even deadly, procedures for all women.**
