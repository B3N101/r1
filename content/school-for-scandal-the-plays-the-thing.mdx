Just a few months into the new school year, the fall play rehearsal process is well underway. As the first official Middlesex showing of the play is slated for November 11, cast members are now fully immersed in the tiring yet rewarding process of bringing the production of _School for Scandal_ to life. This year’s fall play, set in London, was written in 1777 by Richard Sheridan and follows the tumultuous life of women with an insatiable appetite for gossip.

_School for Scandal_ is a spirited classical comedy with many appealing qualities. Tom Kane, Head of Performing Arts explained that he chose the play because there is “something about [_School for Scandal_] being 250 years old that frees [one] up to'' push boundaries through exploring new facets of creative expression. 

Compared to present-day reality, _School for Scandal_ takes place in an unrealistic setting that allows Kane to disregard the restricting boundaries of casting. **Kane can now push limiting gender restrictions and openly assign roles based on other merits. Thus, _School for Scandal_ provides the ideal classic farce for Kane to construct his “imaginary world.”**

Although _School for Scandal_’s distant time period provides Kane with creative liberties, it is also the cause of a significant hurdle. The play’s use of old English hinders cast members’ straightforward comprehension of their lines. A core element of accurately depicting a character is the ability to accompany a script with relatable emotions. Cast members must step beyond a superficial understanding of the script to portray characters to the fullest extent.

Meanwhile, Kane must additionally transport the elements of the original script of _School for Scandal_ into the twenty-first century through a series of modifications. Kane stated that many of his efforts were put into making “language that is 250 years old not feel old,” assisting cast members in relating to the script and making the language more accessible to the audience. But Kane, in addition to cast members, was effectively able to address their challenges and create a positive environment. 

**This fall is the first time Middlesex rehearsals have been mask-free in two years, contributing to the revival of a pre-covid rehearsal environment.** These rehearsal conditions have created a more communicative and joyful atmosphere that encourages actors to take risks. Kane appreciates  “the huge physical … and over-the-top choices” this year’s cast makes. 

Sophie Bruno ’24, a junior lead in the play, appreciates the cheerful environment that inspires excellence and fun. Bruno enjoys “joking around during rehearsal” while “trying scenes in different ways to get the most laughs.” 

Overall the fall play is on track, with each member contributing time and effort to the overall success of _School for Scandal_. The environment of the play fosters values of joy and excellence and pushes each individual to reach their potential. The actors and actresses of Middlesex offer a promising fall production of _School for Scandal_.
