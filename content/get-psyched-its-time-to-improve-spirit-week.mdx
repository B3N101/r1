Middlesex has an annual tradition of spirit week, which is a week leading up to St. George’s Day intended to raise school spirit. Senior leaders are tasked with coordinating daily, all-school clothing psychs and encouraging as many community members as possible to participate in these psychs. Despite multiple emails and announcements leading up to spirit week, psych participation is noticeably surprisingly low, begging multiple questions: **Why do some people participate in psychs more than others? How can we gain higher participation in psychs? Do psychs actually raise school spirit?**

This year, student activities leaders publicized spirit week via email. Prior to spirit week, the spirit heads sent an email with the subject line, “VERY CRITICAL INFORMATION.” Within the email, written in multicolored font, was a list of daily psych themes, which ranged from “BBQ Dad Vs. Soccer Mom” to “MX Apparel.” Although students received an email bursting with motivation to dress up, many students still did not choose to do so. This may have occurred, at least in part, due to the fact that students needed more frequent reminders about the psychs, both before spirit week and during spirit week. Despite the eye-catching email, Angela Huffer ‘26 says **“I forgot about the psychs as the week went on because I wasn’t reminded of them.”**

While the psychs did generate some school spirit leading up to St. George’s Day, school spirit could be drastically raised if more people participated. Kate McBride ‘24 says that **“the psychs only work if the majority of the school is actually doing them,”** and believes the lack of participation could be attributed to the fact that “lots of people don’t have the clothing items needed to do the more specific themes.” To solve this issue, Huffer believes that “the spirit heads could send an email more in advance so people can find all the clothes they need for the psych, or they could do more simple psychs and [psychs] that are more tied to Middlesex and St. George’s Day.”

Psychs could also raise school spirit if they were more directly related to the goal of getting people excited to beat St. George’s. Huffer says, “the people who did dress up had fun costumes…but the themes were random and not relevant to St. George’s Day.” While it is exciting to see people dressed up in a psych, the psychs may raise more school spirit if the daily themes were all tied to Middlesex and St. George’s Day in some way. Huffer says she “liked the day where everyone wore the St. George’s Day shirts because it was the easiest and was obviously related to St. George’s Day.”

Although Spirit week could be improved, it still accomplishes its goal of bringing the Middlesex community together at least somewhat. While McBride acknowledges some flaws with spirit week, namely that not enough people participate, she nevertheless believes that **spirit week is “a good way to bring the community together,”** and does so the best if everyone “fully embrace[s] the psych.” Overall, while spirit heads could work to raise psych participation and the focus of the psychs could be centered more around Middlesex, McBride still believes **“the psychs make St. George’s week a week to look forward to.”**
