Following Red Bull’s World Championship charge last season, in which they won the Drivers’ Championship but fell short in the Constructors’ Championship to Mercedes, the Milton-Keynes based F1 team have enjoyed a flying start to this year’s season. Spearheaded by Christian Horner, Red Bull’s team principal, and Max Verstappen, F1’s new dominant driver, the team have clinched first place 12 times this season, with seven races left to go. Red Bull’s 12 wins seem even more impressive when one considers the next constructor on the leaderboard, Ferrari, only has four race wins. Besides Red Bull and Ferrari, no other constructor has clinched a race win this season. Furthermore, Red Bull have achieved the most podium appearances this season as well, with 20, compared to Ferrari’s 14 and Mercedes’ 13.

In the race for the Drivers’ Championship, there is a similar story. Verstappen leads Ferrari’s Leclerc by a whopping 116 points with 11 race wins and 13 podium appearances, compared to Leclerc’s three race wins and seven podium appearances. **As Formula 1 nears its last couple of races, it looks almost certain that Red Bull will finish the season victorious.**

While many may be familiar with the awe-striking races of Max Verstappen and the high spectacle and drama of F1 cars speeding down a straight, some might only know Red Bull as the caffeinated energy drink which “gives you wings,” as their slogan suggests. Red Bull Racing was founded in 2004 as one of the energy drink’s several forays into sports. In 2008, at the dawn of significant aerodynamics-related regulation changes which leveled the playing field for less established F1 teams, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner signed Sebastian Vettel. From then on, Vettel dominated F1 with Red Bull, winning four world championships between 2010 and 2014. This run of success cemented Red Bull and Christian Horner as perennial title-contenders, competing with the likes of Ferrari, McLaren, and Mercedes. When Vettel left Red Bull for Ferrari after the 2014 season, Mercedes, led by world-class driver Lewis Hamilton, became the new dominant force in F1, winning eight consecutive world championships. Then Max Verstappen, a lauded young prospect of the sport, fully realized his potential and won the Driver’s Championship last season, beating out a fierce Mercedes team which included the great Lewis Hamilton.

Many attribute Red Bull’s success this season to the fearless and experienced driving of Max Verstappen, who is arguably the best driver in Formula 1 right now. While in his career’s early years Verstappen struggled with brash and unrefined driving, he appears to have found his stride, as his racing results have been quite positive. **Another reason behind Red Bull’s enormous lead is the inconsistency of Ferrari’s team and their questionable leadership under team principal Mattia Binotto.** On multiple occasions, Ferrari have squandered opportunities for race wins. For example, an especially glaring mistake occurred in the Hungarian Grand Prix when Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc, comfortably leading the race, was called in for a pit stop in response to a Red Bull pitting “undercut” in the middle of the pack. In addition, slower, hard-compound tires were fitted to Leclerc’s car (the only tire option to last the rest of the race as there were 32 laps remaining), making LeClerc unable to defend from Verstappen, who went on to win the race.

While the competition may be nowhere near as sure-footed as Red Bull, Christian Horner’s team still deserves immense credit for the work they have put in during the eight years they sat behind Mercedes in the world championship, and Max Verstappen, especially, deserves plenty of praise for capitalizing on his team’s capabilities, invigorating the world of F1 with incredible race performances. Although some argue that F1 is boring with teams that dominate year after year, this phenomenon proves how difficult it is to claim that top spot in the championship. **Red Bull have shown they deserve this year’s world championship, and based on their performances, Red Bull and Max Verstappen will clinch the coveted title.**
