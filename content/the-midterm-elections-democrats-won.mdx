The 2022 midterms boasted a slightly surprising win for Democrats who gained a Senate seat and narrowly lost the House, even though most parties who control the White House lose big in the midterms. It was, in fact, the best midterm showing for a party that controls the White House in 20 years, and multiple factors caused this win.

In the Senate races of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and New Hampshire, Donald Trump pushed his preferred candidate past the primary and into the general election, and each of these candidates lost, destroying Republicans’ chances of winning the Senate and putting Trump's credibility into question. In a statewide election like the Senate, candidate quality mattered more to voters, and these Republican candidates did not have the best reputation. For example, Herschel Walker, a Republican candidate for Georgia, was surrounded by many scandals, including one involving him paying an ex-girlfriend to have an abortion according to the Daily Beast and the New York Times.

However, in the House races, Donald Trump’s candidates won more seats than in the Senate, because these races are in smaller districts where candidate quality does not matter as much to voters. Furthermore, some polls may have been inaccurate, although most races were so tight that the polls ultimately could go either way. The youth turnout was also pivotal, as 63 percent voted Democrat in House races, and according to The Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), youth turnout in swing states was especially high: 31 percent compared to the national average of 27 percent.

However, the most important factor in the outcome of the midterms, I think, was the debate over abortion and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Typically, voters respond to bad things happening in the country by voting against the party in control of the White House, which is the Democrats; however, this time, conservatives, in the Supreme Court, were the ones who created unfavorable change. Before the overturning of Roe V. Wade, polls were suggesting that there would be a huge red wave, but after, polls suggested that this red wave was starting to cool, becoming more of a ripple.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a polling website, 38 percent of first-time voters, 37 percent of Democrats, 34 percent of voters under 30, and 34 percent of female voters under 50 said that the Court’s decision was the “single most important factor” in their vote choice. With all this information, abortion was clearly one of the most deciding factors in this election.

One thing to ponder, though, is how there may never be another wave election in which one party wins big because voters are so attached to their party and views, and they believe their party will solve their problems instead of looking for another solution. Instead of looking to the other party’s campaigns and policies when they are unhappy, voters are much more inclined to just stick with their party. Thus, it does not matter what is happening in the country, voters will stay loyal to their party and always think that their party has the best solution.

Ultimately, no one factor caused the Democrats to win, but all the factors combined allowed the Democrats to win.
