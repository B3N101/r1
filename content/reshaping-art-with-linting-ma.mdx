When considering the most passionate artists on campus, Linting Ma ’23 should be at the top of the list. Besides being a volleyball player, dance captain, and crew coxswain, she is also a very talented potter.

Ma began her story with pottery when she was ten. She signed up for a ceramics class in a ceramics artist’s basement and began making a basic mug. The age of ten was too young for very complex techniques, so she treated those early days as purely practice. The first part of her experience with ceramics outside of Middlesex was mainly concentrated on wheel working and “wedging,” which is a technique of getting bubbles out of clay by slamming it.

She said that she “needed to get help from the lady to descend the clay in the center of the wheel.” At that point in her learning experience, she didn’t do much correctly, but she was delighted to “just have fun.”

What makes ceramics so special to her compared to other forms of visual art is the quite literally three-dimensional opportunities it presents. Ma says, “ceramics offer more possibilities to be creative. You can shape it however you want by using different materials but have to think a lot about turning your imagination to the actual work.”

When she is struggling with schoolwork, she enjoys going to the studio to give herself some space. This sentiment is also why she strongly believes that art courses can help students feel “less stress.”

Indeed, making ceramic art is deeply enjoyable to her, but she doesn’t isolate herself in this experience. “Working with other potters could be different rather than just working alone,” she remarks. Commenting about how the Middlesex ceramics programs engage people, Ma says, “most of the people didn’t come for interest…but it bonds varieties of people and the community together more.”

The studio is a light-hearted, non-stress environment. “I was always excited to go to the ceramic class,” she recaps. “You can learn more about the community and yourself just through talking or creating anything you want.”

Ma enjoys the “making part” more than the final product. Ceramics is all about learning how to attach, make, use, and think but rather than already knowing everything, she points out. She remarks, “it will be more fun if it’s accessible to more people because people don’t even need to know anything to start.” Offering more opportunities to the community can unite and “drag more people into their real interest” they may not have even discovered yet, she explains.

A potter might fail numerous times because it is difficult to arrange all of your ideas and make them better the next time. Still, Ma says, “whenever you fail, you might be sad or disappointed because you put in all the work, but you have to start with a simple piece of clay and be creative from there.” After all, that’s how Linting Ma herself began her pottery journey––with plenty of trial, error, and trial again.
