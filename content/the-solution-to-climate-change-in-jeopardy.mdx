Since climate changeâ€™s grand arrival as a concerning mainstream issue in 1988, people have targeted the decreased consumption of gas or oil-based energy sources as a means to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. Venture capitalists like Elon Musk, Oliver Zipse, and Jeff Bezos have innovated and profited from the terrifying threat of climate change, creating lithium-ion batteries as an alternative to gas energy. For years, the general public has rightly believed that lithium-ion batteries could be the ultimate path towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions and slowing the impact of climate change. However, recently, research has found that lithium may not actually be the grand solution to climate change as we expected.

While lithium-ion batteries have proved to be an effective energy source for high carbon-output luxuries such as cars, they present an entirely different issue: these energy sources are extremely sensitive to high temperatures and are even more flammable than oil. Hoverboards, self balancing scooters that use lithium-ion batteries, frequently appear in headlines for random explosions, raising widespread fear amongst users. **Large quantities of lithium cause tremendous, even lethal, damage to many innocent people**. After all, the impact of an explosion from a Tesla Model X is much greater than a hoverboard. 

Furthermore, a lithium explosion is significantly harder to extinguish than gas. Those fires can only be extinguished after being flooded with high amounts of water, and are very likely to reignite. Therefore, containing a lithium-ion battery explosion requires drastic amounts of resources. Moreover, upon exploding, lithium-ion batteries release toxic gasses like hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrofluoric acid. 

Some rightly argue that lithium-ion battery explosions are quite infrequent and are willing to take the risk, for the chances of a lithium-ion battery lighting into powerful, toxic flames is close to one in a million. Whilst the chances are indeed slim, however, the aftermath of the explosions would be catastrophic: toxic fumes would spread like wildfire and first responders would struggle significantly to put the fires out. Since 2018, over 200 significant lithium-ion battery explosions have occurred, a number that correlates the increase in lithium usage.

Tesla cars exclusively use lithium-ion batteries as the energy source, and several explosions have occurred. However, upon being asked about these issues, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk assured the public that Tesla has the technology to eliminate the risks of explosion.

**Lithium-ion batteries are one of the most powerful energy sources and best replacements to oil-based energy sources.** Thus, they should be heavily researched in the future, and the role of government and enterprise should be the prioritization of the well-being of the people. Therefore, while we, the people, must find a replacement for oil-based energy sources with haste, we must also ensure that the energy sources we use are safe. Lithium-ion battery explosions may be rare, but they are deadly; therefore, we must innovate to make these batteries as safe as possible for the public and the economy.
