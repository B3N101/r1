**Xi Jinping is now the most powerful leader in China since Mao Zedong, beginning his third term in office and tightening his control over the Communist Party and the country as a whole**. However, just before the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party(CCP) met in October, a protestor disguised as a construction worker walked onto Beijing’s Sitong Bridge, lit a fire, and held up a sign that read, “Life NOT Zero-Covid Policy; Freedom NOT Lockdown; Dignity NOT Lies; Reform NOT Regression; Elections NOT Dictatorship; Citizens NOT Slaves,” and another sign calling for Xi’s removal from office. This protestor posted their beliefs about Xi Jinping on social media, with thousands of people re-posting his post or even posting their own thoughts. However, within hours, all of these posts were taken down by the government and immediately censored.

Even though the posts were quickly taken down, they still had a big impact in China and around the globe, because those who saw these anti-China remarks will remember them. Now, suffice it to say, these protests will not make a huge difference in China because of the incredible control the government has over every Chinese citizen, dispensing its authority by censoring speech and imprisoning those that speak up. However, they could make a difference on the international level. Chinese college students around the world saw these protests and spoke up in their respective countries. Now, every government around the world knows that the Chinese people are not satisfied with the current situation in China.

Countries have known for a long time that China restricts free speech and will continue to do so. However, with the increased protests and public shows of discontent, many now realize that if it wasn't for this censoring, China would be in big trouble and other countries may be able to exploit that. **With the censorship, although some of the population is not satisfied, Xi will continue to rule with an iron fist and take down these small protests before they develop into bigger upheavals.**

Xi has already recreated China in his name, with a strong presence throughout the country. At the 20th National Congress, Xi appointed his closest advisors and confidants to the Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s most powerful decision-making body, cementing his rule even further. With these developments, as of now, there is no successor lined up to take Xi Jinping’s spot as Chairman of China, creating mutterings of the word ‘dictator’ around the world. Before 2018, the Chinese constitution stipulated that a president could not serve more than two terms, or 10 years, but in 2018, this law was abolished, securing Xi’s power for years to come.

With these protests may come unrest, but Xi Jinping’s only worry is to consolidate his power even further and create a secure China with no threats from the inside nor outside. However, as technology evolves and more social media platforms rise to prominence, we can only hope that China’s power to censor will dim, and anti-CCP ideas will start to spread. As Xi Jinping gains more power, he may become unstoppable and could inflict pain on every citizen in China and the world. As of now, though, the whole world is dependent on China for much of its manufacturing needs. With the world just coming out of a pandemic and struggling with the consequences, it may not be the best time for protests in China to occur.
