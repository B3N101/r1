Liz Truss’s rule was a remarkable failure – an economic failure, a political failure, and a conservative party failure. Liz Truss’s economic policies based on Thatcherism and trickle-down economics brought down the currency of the United Kingdom, the pound, leading to market uncertainty. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) publicly criticized her government’s policies, telling her government to “re-evaluate” its policies. Her policies included a cap on average household energy bills, with the Energy Price Guarantee which would cap bills at £2500 and would have cost the U.K. between £70 and £140 billion. In addition to an increase in spending via the Energy Price Guarantee, Kwasi Kwarteng, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced “The Growth Plan of 2022,” also known as the “mini-budget.” The plan would cut taxes significantly for the wealthy, mainly through the abolition of the 45% higher rate of income tax, the scrapping of a limit on bankers’ bonuses, and the cancellation of an increase on corporate taxes, while having less significant cuts for the common people with just a 1% decrease in the standard income tax rate. 

Just like Liz Truss’s rule, the “mini-budget” was a complete disaster. The idea of increasing spending through the Energy Price Guarantee while lowering income through tax cuts caused an increase in inflation, a crash in the pound, and a crash in the FTSE 100, U.K.’s version of the S&P 500. It also irreparably damaged the view on trickle-down economics and Thatcherism, as Liz Truss' policies mimicked the prior “success” of Thatcher’s policies. Moreover, the mini-budget’s economic turmoil also further increased the U.K.’s inflation rate and caused mortgage rates to rise significantly in itself, preventing economic growth in contrast to Liz Truss’s goal of bringing growth back to the U.K. economy, which still hasn’t recovered from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The U.K. is still the only country in the G7 with a lower GDP now than in 2020.

Additionally, the economic damage during  Liz Truss’s reign caused a massive change in her government. First, the government was forced to reverse most of the policies from the “mini-budget” and change the Energy Price Guarentee’s duration to six months from an initial two-year term. Moreover, within her cabinet, Liz Truss had to change the leadership, as she sacked Kwarteng, replacing him with Jeremy Hunt who led the U-turn in policy. Truss lost control within her own government, with Jeremy Hunt as the de facto government leader while stabilizing the economy. Without the policies that Liz Truss initially presented and with a government that looked like a shell of its stated purpose, **Liz Truss’s government was a ticking time bomb**. This upcoming end of her rule was best noted by the leader of the opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer, during Liz Truss’s final Prime Minister’s questions, who repeated all of her reversed policies and then asked, **“So, why is she still here?”**

Ultimately, Liz Truss’s unremarkable rule ended with her resignation. Her political career is irreparably damaged, especially when according to a [YouGov](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/10/18/liz-trusss-net-favourability-rating-falls-70) poll in October 2022, she had a minus 70 net favorability score. Additionally, the ruling Conservative party also has disastrous approval ratings, and it appears almost certain that the Labour party will gain the leadership in the next general election. Specifically on the topic of a general election, many people are calling for an early election, as the current leadership doesn’t represent the views of the people. The government is thus universally viewed as undemocratic, with the U.K. population having no say on the leadership election which put her into power, only the Conservative party members which compose just [0.3 ](http://bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60037657)percent of the UK electorate. Liz Truss has fallen, and she has taken her political future, the economy, and her party with her.
