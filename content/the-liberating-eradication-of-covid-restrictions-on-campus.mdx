Since COVID first hit the US in March of 2020, Middlesex underwent several policy changes in an effort to diminish the damage of the virus. From remote learning to mandatory masking and weekly testing, the Middlesex experience was completely transformed. Nevertheless, this September, **for the first time since the start of the pandemic, a sense of normalcy has been restored on Middlesex’s campus**. Masks are now optional, and mandatory testing is a thing of the past. What prompted the relaxation of COVID restrictions, and what is the general attitude across campus toward the relaxed rules?

As more is discovered about the symptoms and sequela of COVID, Middlesex has adjusted restrictions according to the recommendations of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). According to Meg McLaughlin, Middlesex’s Director of Health and Wellness, accumulated data suggests that the consequences of COVID on young adults are less severe than those experienced by other age groups, and teenagers, generally speaking, recover more rapidly. Thus, as McLaughlin stated, **it is most effective to implement restrictions that are customized according to the needs of a specific group**. The relaxation of limitations on campus was guided by suggestions from both national and local professionals, aiming to establish a safe learning environment for teenagers while also re-establishing a sense of normalcy.

With that sense of normalcy, however, has inevitably come a series of COVID cases on campus. **Testing positive for COVID, especially in the first few weeks of school, can be tiresome and distressing**, and experiencing symptoms, even if they’re mild, is no walk in the park for anyone. Abby Tribush, a freshman who tested positive during her first few weeks on campus, noted how “challenging” it was to try to participate in class while on Zoom. To make matters worse, the first few weeks are chaotic ones, and as a result Abby has had to make up five different tests. Katie Chen, also a freshman, experienced only three days of “normal” school life before contracting the virus. She laments having to miss out on such pivotal activities, such as square dance and the club fair, and feels as though she hasn’t had many opportunities to meet others because she was in quarantine.

However, despite the inconveniences brought about by COVID on campus, students generally hold an approving attitude toward relaxed restrictions. Even Katie is grateful for Middlesex’s policies, as, after enduring three months of lockdown and two years of strict mask requirements in China, **she relishes the opportunity to finally “see the lower portions of peoples’ faces.”** Abby similarly reported frustration with the torturous months of remote learning that she endured in middle school, and appreciate the interactions she has been able to have during her time at MX, despite the challenges accompanied by testing positive.

Despite relaxed restrictions, however, MX is ready to provide any and all necessary medical care for those who do contract COVID. The wellness center is accessible 24/7 for students and provides a space to safely quarantine. And, while testing is no longer mandatory, the wellness center makes attaining a test easy if necessary.

All in all, with Middlesex’s newly loosened COVID restrictions, some students have faced difficulties after contracting the virus. All students, however, now have the freedom to make connections and friendships that truly define the high school experience.
