King Charles III is the new King of the United Kingdom, and with this higher role, he plans to implement changes to the monarchy. While his predecessor, the late and beloved Queen Elizabeth II, curried immense favor from virtually all British peoples and those in parliament by staying out of politics and presenting an enduring facade of justice and maternal empathy, the new King has long been outspoken about his views.

**Namely, Charles is extremely passionate about the fight against climate change and preserving the natural world.**

For the past few decades, Charles has been campaigning for multiple environmental efforts, such as carbon produced by cities and urban architecture, which often prohibits walkability and otherwise non-harmful modes of transportation. In 1993 he launched Poundbury, an artificial village in Dorset in southern England that utilizes low-rise buildings built to human scale, an emphasis on sustainable transport and building materials, and the integration of workplaces and dwellings within the village, ultimately diminishing the dependence on cars.

King Charles has also played a significant role in organizing sustainable industry development. In 2021, he led the Terra Carta document signage of over 500 chief executives of some of the most influential companies, pledging to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2050. The Terra Carta is part of his Sustainable Markets Initiative launched in 2020.

Charles’ own house, Highgrove, is a testament to his dedication to sustainability. Sustainable heating, renewable energy, and a water system that takes water from gutters and repurposes it for water in toilets are several examples of Charles’ commitment. Furthermore, renowned gardens surrounding the bucolic country house serve as an explicit celebration of natural beauty.

While there is no doubt of Charles’ oft-politicized ideas on the environment, there is uncertainty over whether Charles will continue to lead and support environmental campaigns to the level he did as Prince of Wales. The role of the King was to represent the British people fully and to refrain from politics (Elizabeth would stay “above politics”). Political dealings are a job the monarch is traditionally supposed to leave solely to Parliament. Charles will certainly not be utterly silent on his most impassioned issue, but **he must withhold some of the enthusiasm with which he conducted his climate activities and adopt the more neutral stance his mother perfected.**

When Elizabeth inherited the throne, she was 25–her beliefs and ideas were not known to the public, and thus she became the figurehead of the U.K. and its territories with a quasi-blank slate. She was so ardently adored because of her unwavering dignity and supreme calm; she wielded an image remarkably free of blemishes.

The new King Charles III will have enormous shoes to fill regardless of his work in climate issues. Charles already assumes the role of King less popular than his predecessor. Will he risk using his more significant influence on the politicized subject of sustainability and the reduction of climate change for the full support of his people?
