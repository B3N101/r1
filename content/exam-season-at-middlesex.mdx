When Thanksgiving break came to an end, exams were fast approaching, and the looming pressure started to overwhelm many students. Attempting to perform well on their exams and achieve good grades before Christmas break were students’ main sources of stress. Some of them found it difficult to focus and retain information when studying, others even struggled to sleep at night due to anxiety. To make students feel more comfortable, Middlesex teachers had carefully designed the exam schedules and provided useful guidance. Let’s take a look at them and see how they could help students in a practical sense.

This year’s winter exam began on Monday, December 12th, and continued through Friday, December 16th. As usual, what each MX student cared most about was the exam schedule, which determined their strategies to review the exam. The STEM subjects were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday, followed by humanities projects from Wednesday through Friday. Some students liked the way that math and science were put on consecutive days as it’s easier to focus on studying for STEM at once, rather than switching back and forth between humanities and STEM subjects. For some students who took AP Physics and Pre-Calculus or Calculus simultaneously, reviewing for the physics exam helped to reinforce their understanding of math concepts as well. In addition, since most of the students had only one exam to deal with each day, they could make great use of the afternoon and evening time to prepare for the next day’s subject. However, many students also complained about this year’s exam schedule. They did not prefer to have history on the last day of the exam week. Many said that since history review required a large amount of memory work, scheduling the history exam on Friday made them worried and confused about their study strategies overall. They struggled with the decision of whether they should study history a little each day or wait until Thursday afternoon to focus on it. In addition, having exams for an entire week can be a test of students' mental endurance, as they may be affected by a previous exam that didn't go as well as they had hoped. The stress and anxiety of performing well on exams can take a toll on students' mental health, and a poor performance on one exam can weigh on their confidence and motivation for the rest of the week.

To maximize students’ comfort during the exam week, Middlesex teachers took various approaches to support the students. Ms. Gerrity went above and beyond by providing helpful hints and specific guidelines for MX students. She not only helped summarize what students could do to review each subject, but also kindly reminded students to stay productive and healthy. These tailored recommendations and strategies can make a big difference in helping students to feel more equipped to tackle their exams. In addition, the school was offering an academic seminar to help students better understand how to approach studying for different subjects. This seminar was particularly valuable for students who may be struggling with a particular subject or who have different learning styles, as it provided a variety of study strategies that students can try and see what works best for them. Finally, exam review sessions were offered to help students review and reinforce their learning. By reviewing material with their peers and a teacher, students can clarify any misunderstandings, ask questions, and solidify their understanding of the material. These review sessions can be an invaluable resource for students as they provide an opportunity to review and reinforce their learning. 

Despite the busy and stressful nature of exam week, there were still opportunities for students to relax and take a break. For example, the yoga club was still meeting during this time, providing students with a chance to de-stress and practice self-care through the physical and mental discipline of yoga. Additionally, the school was offering weekend activities such as recovery Sundays to provide a space for students to relax and recharge. Furthermore, there are exam snack options available from Trader Joe's, which can be a small but welcome indulgence during a hectic week.
