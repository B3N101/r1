**The United Nations has repeatedly restrained its punches regarding China, the second-biggest contributor to the organization, in an attempt to keep relations with the government amicable**. One of its so-called goals is to promote the well-being of the peoples of the world; however, it took the organization five years after becoming aware of human rights abuses in Xinjiang to publish a report detailing the detainment and torture of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities, and, throughout the report, they stopped short of fully condemning the Chinese government’s actions.

Since 2019, China has imprisoned over one million Uyghurs and other Muslim groups and subjected those not detained to intense surveillance, religious restrictions, forced labor, and forced sterilizations, according to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations. China has denied all of these allegations, asserting that these detention facilities are reeducation camps for terrorists and religious extremists, but, based on the testimony of 40 first-hand witnesses, this claim is ultimately false. The Chinese government has also stated that the forced detainment of Uyghurs stopped in 2019, but based on satellite images, the human rights abuses are still ongoing and are far from over.

Additionally, China has asserted influence over the United Nations recently, especially in its peace and security work, becoming the second-largest contributor to the U.N. and allying with Russia to veto humanitarian projects. **Thus, to not hurt their relationship with China, the U.N. used muted language when condemning the human rights abuses in Xinjiang in their report, only going as far as saying their actions “may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.”** The United States and other governments around the world have condemned the human rights abuses as genocide against the Muslim minority in China, but the U.N. declined to use the word “genocide,” showing that they are trying to appease China.

In May of 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights visited Xinjiang, China in a highly orchestrated tour by the Chinese government, the first of its kind since 2005. However, the visit only served one purpose: to show the Chinese government and the world that China had the U.N.’s approval. Hence, the U.N. published this report because of pressure from governments and human rights organizations from around the world, but it also stepped short of using the word “genocide,” because it wanted to keep its relationship with China on good terms.

China responded to the report by calling it a “farse,” and China’s ambassador to the U.N. said “its purpose is to undermine China’s stability and obstruct China’s development,” claiming it was a politically motivated attempt to smear China, according to the _Washington Post_. **As much as the report may have damaged China’s reputation, which has never been stellar, the report won’t truly bear any fruit because it will not stop China from oppressing the Muslim minority in Xinjiang**. The U.S. and other nations have placed sanctions on top Chinese officials, but the Chinese government as a whole will still operate in its interests to indoctrinate everybody into the party’s doctrine.

Ultimately, this report has taught us two lessons, one that has always been known and one that is just starting to appear. The U.N. is not that effective at enforcing its policies on sovereign nations, especially those as powerful as China, and it will continue to be ineffective. Also, China is gaining considerable power in the United Nations and will certainly cause a problem if it continues to break international law against human rights abuses and veto actions against human rights abuses, which will likely occur.
