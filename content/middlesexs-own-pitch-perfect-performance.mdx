As the Friday night of Family Weekend came to an end following the Jazz Ensemble’s performance, families and students came to the chapel to listen to the many choirs of Middlesex perform a collection of songs they had been working on since early September. The pews filled with excited audience members, ready to listen to the culmination of many weeks of work performed by the multitude of choirs, starting with SWAG, one of the girls' acapella groups, and then moving on to the groups composed of the Small Chorus––The MxOlydians, Bateman’s Bullfrogs, and the whole of Small Chorus together.

This year, resounding applause and enthusiasm met SWAG’s performance of “Grenade,” a classic tune by Bruno Mars. Since “Grenade” was Music Faculty Pedro Lobato’s first official performance with a choral group at Middlesex, it was exciting as an audience member to hear how he cultivated this song with these singers. The performance continued with the Bullfrogs, who sang “Classic” by MKTO with soloists Ryan Noble ’23 and Tim Gachuki ’23. As always, the Bullfrogs brought great energy and spirit.

Head of The Music Department Pierson Wetzel expressed his enthusiasm for the performance in the days following it, stating that he “was really pleased with it, and thought [the groups] sounded great.” The MxOlydians, contrasting with the upbeat Classic by the Bullfrogs, sang the Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).” Julia Blake ’26, one of the song’s soloists and one of the new members of the MxOlydians, shares her excitement about her first performance in the chapel: **though labeling the performance as “very exciting,” Blake also mentioned that it was nerve-wracking, as it was one of her first times performing at a new school, she had a solo on the piece, and the event was packed.** Still, the supportive nature of the group helped her feel confident about her performance.

Regarding the preparation of the performance, Blake felt as if the groups had worked hard to finalize the songs, with hour-long practices multiple times a week, both separately as the MxOlydians and the Bullfrogs and then combined rehearsals as the full Small Choir. Parker Boyden, a choral officer, senior member, and soloist in the performance, thinks the group “performed really well,”\*\* **and she mentions how performances like these are always an exciting moment for the choirs. In fact, she adds that **sometimes the group is so excited that Wetzel has to remind the singers to preserve their voices before the performance\*\*. After a striking first performance of the year, the choral groups will make their next big appearance in front of the school community at the Holiday Concert in December.
