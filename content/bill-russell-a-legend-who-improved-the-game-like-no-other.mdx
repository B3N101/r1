The basketball world lost a trailblazer when Boston Celtics legend Bill Russell passed away on July 31st at the age of 88. It was a tremendous loss for not just the Celtics and the NBA, but also the country, because Russell’s impact went far beyond the basketball court.

In high school, Russell was only an above-average basketball player with some unusual defensive skills. He failed to impress college recruiters and received only one scholarship offer from the University of San Francisco, which Russell eagerly accepted. USF took advantage of Russell’s defensive skills to become a force in college basketball, winning two NCAA championships during his time. In the process, Russell’s defensive dominance caught the attention of Celtics coach Red Auerbach, who traded for him at the 1956 NBA draft. 

Russell quickly developed into one of the greatest players in NBA history. During his career, **he helped the Celtics win 11 NBA championships, including eight straight from 1959 to 1966.** Russell himself was a five-time league MVP and 12-time All-Star. He even became a player-coach in the final two years of his career with the Celtics and won two more NBA championships. He was the first Black coach in a major American sports league.

On the court, Russell’s defensive skills and ability to block shots transformed the center position and changed the game of professional basketball. His athleticism allowed him to excel in man-to-man defense, blocking and rebounding shots. His leadership and ability to bring out the best in others were unparalleled. 

Former NBA player and head coach Don Nelson said, “There are two types of superstars. One makes himself look good at the expense of the other guys on the floor. But there's another type who makes the players around him look better than they are, and that's the type Russell was.”

Beyond the basketball court, Russell was a dedicated civil rights activist. He was no stranger to racism, as he grew up in segregated Louisiana, and his home in Massachusetts was vandalized in the early 1960s. When he was drafted to the Celtics, he was the only Black player during an era when racism was rampant throughout the United States. He led the boycott of an NBA game in 1961 in protest of an incident in Kentucky where two of his Black teammates were refused service at a local restaurant. Later, he opened an integrated basketball camp in Mississippi following the murder of another civil rights activist. Back in Boston, Russell actively advocated for racial justice, leaving the city in a more inclusive environment. **He vocally supported the one-day Black student boycott of Boston's public schools to protest segregation.** In 1966, he helped plan the graduation and spoke to graduates at a predominantly Black high school near Boston. Russell made such an impact on others that President Obama presented Russell with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, in 2011 for his work on and off the court. Through his work, Russell has paved the way for athletes, such as LeBron James and Jaylen Brown, to not only be athletes but also activists.

Though Bill Russell is no longer with us, there is no doubt that his impact will be felt for years to come.
