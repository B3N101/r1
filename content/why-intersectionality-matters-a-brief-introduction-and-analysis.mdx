Intersectionality, intersectionality, intersectionality. It’s the one word that brings a glaze of confusion in our eyes when we first hear it. The term alone is so heavy, politically-charged, and seemingly pedantic that it encourages us to shy away from it. **But we cannot avoid something because it’s unfamiliar — in fact, the concept of intersectionality might hit closer to home than you think.**

The idea of intersectionality has long been in existence, but the term was not officially coined until 1989, when scholar and Black feminist Kimberlé Crenshaw pointed out the varying forms of discrimination individuals with overlapping identities faced. Intersectionality recognizes the world is not black-and-white; it takes into account the nuance of one’s experiences, especially in regards to discrimination predominantly based on race, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, ability, religion, age, weight, physical appearance, and more. **Because of the combined effects of these identities, individuals must confront different degrees of oppression and privilege in their lives.** A Black, queer woman, for example, will face unique barriers in her life as the resulting sum of her race, gender, and sexual orientation. 

Intersectionality is not just a concept; it is a lens which we may use to analyze social issues and view the world. **Through this lens, we learn to better understand both ourselves and the people around us: we learn about why we interact with the world the way we do** (and vice versa), why past events have shaped us into who we are right now, and why others often treat us the way they do. None of these “why”s can be answered easily, proving that identities are complex and multidimensional parts of us.

Often, the term “interconnectedness” slips into discussions of intersectionality. Everything has ties to everything; climate change and its disproportionate effect on low-income communities is a perfect example. Often, low-income neighborhoods have less facilities in place to mitigate the effects of climate change: there are fewer trees, less access to air-conditioning, and less heat-reducing infrastructure in place. A 2021 study done by the Public Library of Science showed that the difference between tree cover in high-income and low-income blocks averages around 15.2%, with the greatest disparity evident in the northeast United States where low-income blocks in urban areas have 30% less tree cover and are 39.2°F hotter. According to the EHP (Environmental Health Perspectives), heat wave mortality risk increases 2.49% for every 1°F increase in heat waves, leaving residents of these communities most vulnerable to heat-related health problems. Moreover, due to the long history of racist, segregationist housing policies in the U.S., high-poverty neighborhoods typically consist of a high Black, Latinx, hispanic, or immigrant population. There is an undoubtedly intersecting relationship that connects climate change to socioeconomic status and race.

Just to be clear — intersectionality is not about comparing suffering or competing difficulties. Just as we must recognize the barriers and challenges that intersectionality brings, we must _also_ recognize and celebrate intersectional joy. The strength and power of my community bring me joy. Celebrating the diverse differences between individuals brings me joy. Defying social expectations in order to leave my mark on the world brings me joy. Recognizing and acknowledging the resilience of my community — realizing that it is only through the efforts of generations upon generations of Asian women that have made it possible for me to live as I do today — brings me joy. 

It’s easy to say, “I have no intersection. Nothing about me is intersectional.” That’s not true. **As long as we exist, we embody an intersection of cultures, of ideas, of experiences that make up who we are. None of us are influenced by one factor alone.** Yes, I am a woman; but I’m also a musician, an athlete, a writer, a teenager, a daughter, a granddaughter, a theater-lover, and a Hong-Konger. There is so much more nuance to us all than a singular identity. And that, there, is the essence of intersectionality.
