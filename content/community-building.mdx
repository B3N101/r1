Last year, on my way to assemblies, I would pass students heading anywhere but the same direction as me: the theater. On occasions, when I arrived, I would notice that sometimes my friends were not there. Even faculty members were absent. In fact, one of my classes always joked with our teacher, telling them, “see you at assembly” with a smile and a wink. Finally, the few times when they did make an appearance, some of my fellow peers would exclaim in awe, “I saw you in assembly!”

Many students skipped assembly to study or do homework. After all, the workload at Middlesex seizes time away from rest and fun, and therefore, it appears that students, pressured by the lack of time, took advantage of assembly blocks. As for faculty, they likewise benefited from having extra time to grade assignments, prepare for lessons, or take some sort of break in their day. But now, we have assigned seating. And while some claim it is detrimental, others express their indifference. However, the new assigned seating dynamic does benefit the community as a whole. 

Middlesex School is not simply an academic institution, for it also seeks to maintain a close-knit community, and I believe that was the purpose of the assigned seating. The assigned seating reinforces the values of being together and respectful of both the rules and the people within our community. 

Having assigned seating based on advisory groups enhances the advisory program by ensuring that faculty members catch up with their advisees at least twice a week. Though I usually schedule a free block to meet with my advisor, others do not, so it is a nice opportunity to talk to a trusted adult on campus. Seating by advisory groups also provides another way to bind the community together. Personally, I have gotten to know better my two advisory peers, whom I now consider friends and am able to connect with. Additionally, by having students more likely to attend assembly, students are able to take a break from the type of stimuli they receive throughout a long day of classes. 

Perhaps, another reason for the assigned seating was the check-in process. Twice last year, despite attending assembly and checking in with the senior proctor of my day-house, I received an unexcused absence that I later had to clear. However, the check-in process with the advisor is much smoother and easier. It also does not keep students waiting for proctors to check in, and faculty waiting for proctors to begin their lesson. 

Above all, Middlesex is transitioning from a period when work interfered with the school being a community of unity and respect, to a state in which it seeks to strengthen the importance of togetherness. The assigned seating encourages this community building, while giving students and faculty an opportunity to take a break and making the check-in process much easier.
