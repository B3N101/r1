On July 11, 2022, President Biden released the first high-resolution image from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The telescope is the largest ever launched into space, at a whopping six times larger and 100 times more powerful than its predecessor, the Hubble. Its grandeur has journeyed from outer space to Middlesex, and the images have piqued community members’ interest. 

According to Middlesex’s astronomy technician Dr. Ralph “Skip” Pass, the JWST is so powerful because “it was designed to work at infrared wavelengths,” allowing us “to see where visible light would be 13 billion years ago.” Furthermore, the JWST is “out a million miles from the earth, away from the heat signature of the Earth and the Moon,” and “behind a shield, so that it’s not in the Sun.” Thus “[while] the Hubble, because it was in orbit around the Earth, was limited to about 20 minutes at a time,” noted Dr. Pass, “[the JWST] can stare for days at the same location if we wanted to.” Its impressive focusing capabilities made its images anticipated to be the most clear snapshots of space to date.

The telescope has certainly lived up to expectations. “When you first started seeing the test images coming down,” Dr. Pass said, “you started seeing pinpoint stars, and you started getting really excited, because that means it’s gonna be high quality.” While the pictures thus far were “designed to go for a wow factor,…they do have scientific value.” According to Dr. Pass, “**we’re looking at various aspects of some of the galaxies we hadn’t seen before,** we can see parts of the spectrum of Jupiter that we hadn’t seen before, and over the course of the next couple of years, there will be a lot more studies coming out.”

Mae Rusconi ‘23, head of MX’s astronomy club, was “blown away” upon seeing the images. “I was really excited… just to talk to the astronomy people at Middlesex.” Rusconi hopes to integrate the novel images into club sessions and discussion this year. “There are always ways that astronomy club can do more,” she said, “so one of them might be talking about the James Webb telescope and examining and thinking about the photos.”

Dr. Pass looks forward to student interest in the JWST. “[Student interest] tells me that we’re going to answer the questions that they want to know the answers to. If we get to the point where there’s a lot of interest in doing some studies with [the JWST], then we can try to get hold of some of the data, and have working sessions to go through it.”

While NASA has released processed images, “the initial release of the raw data that made up the images is limited to the principal investigators,” according to Dr. Pass. As more data and studies come out about the telescope’s findings, “then the question becomes for the people of Middlesex,” noted Dr. Pass, “what do we do about this?” Ideas include independent studies and research projects, perhaps involving comparisons between the JWST and Middlesex’s rooftop observatory.

Yet, despite all the awe and glory of the JWST, astronomy club will continue to prioritize taking pictures with its own telescope over analyzing professionally taken ones. **“There’s something very satisfying about having control over your own telescope and collecting your own data,”** said Dr. Pass. “Yes, it’s not going to be James Webb quality, but it’s going to be things that you were able to do yourself.” Inspired by novel advancements like the JWST and grounded in self-taken images, the future of astronomy at MX seems brighter than ever.
