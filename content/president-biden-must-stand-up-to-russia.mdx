On February 17, 2022, Russian authorities detained WNBA star Brittney Griner at a Moscow airport for the alleged possession of cannabis oil, an illegal substance in Russia. She pled guilty to the charges and was recently sentenced to nine years in prison. Her attorney submitted evidence in the Russian court of a doctor’s note for medical cannabis. Ms. Griner also added that she had packed her bags in a rush and did not intend to pack the cannabis oil. The plea may have been a false admission in hopes of leniency, as arguing innocence may have been a lost cause given the Russian court system’s reported 99% conviction rate. 

The U.S. State Department has designated her as being “wrongfully detained,” and President Biden recently offered a prisoner swap: Ms. Griner and another convicted American citizen, Mr. Paul Whelan, for a convicted Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout.

Ms. Griner is trapped in an incredibly sympathetic situation, pressured into playing for international teams by the comparatively low wages of WNBA players. She seems to have made a mistake in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, **stardom should not make one imprisoned American worth more than another.** See the case of Marc Fogel, American school teacher in Moscow recently sentenced to 14 years of hard labor on the charge of cannabis possession. Ms. Griner has been treated as more important than her fellow American. 

But even then, what precedent does a swap for either set? The United States and Russia have frequently performed prisoner swaps, and the exchanges have proven mutually beneficial, a mark that diametrically opposed nations share a human kinship. Throughout history, good faith prison swaps have sent weary, injured, and captive soldiers on both sides back to their home and family. But don’t let Putin and his thugs convince you that this situation is the same as the past. Russia blatantly uses Ms. Griner, along with other imprisoned Americans, as leverage, but this leverage only exists if we let it. 

The notion that an American administration would negotiate the release of one American over another on the basis of fame is shameful. Yet an administration that caves to extortion is downright dangerous. A swap of an internationally wanted criminal for two civilian hostages sends a message to the world: America can be extorted—and extorted we will be. Mr. Biden’s swap opens American nationals around the world to kidnapping for later use as political bargaining chips. In this case, Russia abused the Biden administration's moralistic policy and, perhaps more cynically, his dismal approval ratings, to pressure him into making a terrible deal: a basketball player and a security director in exchange for a globetrotting arms dealer. As China and Russia rear for power, Biden’s foreign policy needs to take a sober look at the real world, in which we cannot have our cake and eat it too. 

President Biden clearly understands this reality: despite promising to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah,” he fist-bumped the crown prince on his recent visit. While the Saudi Arabian government and culture may directly contradict our own values, handing the wealthy, influential, oil-producing nation over to Russia and China on a silver platter would both greatly worsen Saudi human rights and America’s place in the world. On this front, President Biden made a wise, yet unpopular decision in a show of uncharacteristic strength. That momentum must continue. The President cannot cave to the pressure and thereby resign American foreign policy to the same bad deal: exporting progressive values and importing pain at the pump. 

Proponents of such a policy may lambaste decisions, like Mr. Biden’s in Saudi Arabia or mine in this opinion, as cruel or inhumane. They’re half right: humanitarian issues around the world are indeed tragic, but a solely moralistic foreign policy is not the solution. The U.S. is certainly not perfect, but world order led by the United States certainly produces a safer and more equal world than one headed by China or Russia. Such oppressive nations have no qualms with a ruthless and pragmatic path to power—neither can we. As realpolitik entails, maintaining a free world order requires often uncomfortable compromises, like our controversial but crucial partnership with Saudi Arabia and tragic sacrifices like the imprisonment of Ms. Griner and others. **The crux of this wager is the belief that America and her allies, with all of their imperfections, remain a more just order than a Sino-Russian axis.** The calculus we must make is that a flawed American world order is better than a Chinese or Russian one: we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Of course, the challenge in this doctrine lies in the responsibility it delegates to the people. The people have the critical task of preventing the malignant powers of our world from surpassing us, without becoming maligned in the process. This line of reasoning has been used to justify any number of unspeakable actions, to conceal conquest with reason, and yet, I have faith in the American people to draw that line. 

The Biden administration’s treatment of Ms. Griner should serve as a parable for the pitfalls of a moralistic foreign policy. A time for choosing comes again, and America must again choose to stand up to such evils instead of rolling over and appeasing the demands of such malignant states.
