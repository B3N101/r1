Last issue, I wrote about how 2022 was a great year for R & B, but I never really mentioned how it was excellent for the state of music as a whole. Before discussing what the best album of 2022 was, a few notable albums deserve recognition. These albums are Gemini Rights by Steve Lacy, Raised by Hailey Whitters, Flower Shops (The Album) by Ernest, Dawn FM by The Weeknd, and It’s Almost Dry by Pusha T. While these albums did not make it to the top spot, this year, each one of them is still a must listen. That being said, the best album of 2022 is Ants From Up There by Black Country, New Road. 

Despite having never heard of this indie/progressive rock group from the United Kingdom before late November 2022, this has to be one of the most brilliantly constructed pieces of art I have heard since the first time I listened to Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly. 

The layering and the production on the short intro track start the album on a great foot and transition well into the second track, "Chaos Space Marine.” The most impressive part about this song is its vibrant instrumentation. These two beautiful and clearly produced songs excel at setting the tone for the big-band feel of the album. On “Chaos Space Marine,” the listener meets Isaac Wood, the band’s vocalist, who has an incredibly jaded, raspy voice. Wood is a very talented songwriter whose lyrics are cryptic, yet after multiple listens, his lyrics gain clarity through the vibes of each song. 

In the next song, “Concorde,” Wood’s relationship with a significant other comes to the forefront. Due to the low-fi guitar and saddening lyrics, the listener's mind feels transported into the aggravated and depressed heart of Wood, yet due to the uplifting saxophones that seem to build over the entirety of the song; there is a beautiful sensation of hope that leaves the audience wanting to experience the whirlwind of emotions all over again. Seemingly, this entire album is a relationship therapy session.

Although the message behind “Bread Song” remains unclear, a new meaning can be found in every listen of the album. “Bread Song” is the perfect example of this phenomenon because the song serves as a break from the instrumental intensity of the other songs thus far. Wood keeps the listener fully engaged with an intense story filled with a wealth of metaphors and emotions. The next song, “Good Will Hunting,” is perhaps the most upbeat and goofy on the album. 

Although the album has been flawless, emotionally beautiful, and instrumentally genius up to this point, this is where the band makes an artistic statement unlike anything I have heard before. Easily my favorite on the album, the song “Haldern” features invigorating swelling saxophones and pianos. Listening to this song feels like riding an instrumentally and emotionally driven roller coaster. In my opinion, Haldern is Wood’s best vocal performance. His screams in between the thumping drums are deafeningly beautiful and desperate yet filled with unmistakable love and passion. 

Following “Haldern” is “Mark’s Theme,” a beautiful saxophone intermission by Lewis Evans that is a tribute to the saxophonist’s late uncle Mark. I often find myself listening to this song because of its serenity. It constantly reminds me how words will never be able to convey certain emotions the way music does.

“The Place Where He Inserted The Blade,” the album's masterpiece, is one of the most gut-wrenching listens you’ll ever hear. As Wood begs his partner to allow him to help them heal from the traumas of a past relationship, these upbeat, almost sort of cartoonish, instrumentals blare in the background and make for a dichotomy that highlights the difference between how Wood wants to make his relationship feel and how it actually feels. 

“Snow Globes” is a masterclass in layering production. I love how the band allows the listener to engage in the process of layering instruments to create a song, starting with just a guitar and, for three minutes, building the song into a soundscape worthy of Wood’s creative symbolism. The drum solo that blares and fades throughout Wood’s lyrics and the beating guitar is genius, as it reflects Wood’s chaotic, mentally draining state over the course of the relationship and album. Finally, the album closes with “Basketball Shoes,” a ten-minute marathon that is difficult to describe in a way that accurately presents all of its themes.

Ultimately, this album is impossible to describe in writing, so just go ahead and give it a listen. It is unlike any other album I have heard before, which is why it struck me so differently. I hope that one day this album will get the recognition it deserves because of the beauty of its instrumentation and in-sync storytelling, but if it doesn’t, I am glad that it somehow found me.
