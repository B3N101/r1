On November 22nd, only a week after announcing his 2024 presidential bid, former president Donald Trump hosted dinner for Kanye West and Holocaust-denier Nick Fuentes. Just two weeks before, West had threatened on twitter to “Go Death Con 3 on JEWISH PEOPLE,” unleashing a firestorm of controversy that prompted business partners Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga to cut ties with the disgraced rapper. Some point to the criticism directed at Trump’s decision from within the Republican party as evidence that he has gone too far in testing the limits of what he can do without repercussions. And yet, the response from his party is weaker than it initially seemed: Trump’s dinner with Kanye and Fuentes should not come as a surprise — it simply followed the standardized pattern for endorsing hate that Trump has set since his entry to politics.

At first glance, it does seem that his party’s attitude has shifted against the former president. A week after Trump’s dinner with Kanye, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responded to reporters saying that he did not “think [Trump] should have associated with [Kanye] as well.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that “anyone meeting with people advocating that point of view … are [sic] highly unlikely to ever be elected president.” More emphatic was David Friedman, the ambassador to Israel under the Trump administration, calling on “his friend” Trump to “throw those bums out, disavow them and relegate them to the dustbin of history where they belong.”

> **“To my friend Donald Trump, you are better than this. Even a social visit from an antisemite like Kanye West and human scum like Nick Fuentes is unacceptable,” said Friedman.**

Under closer scrutiny, however, we see that the response from within the party carefully avoids criticizing the actual person behind the decision to dine with Kanye.

In the same statement, Leader McCarthy said first that “the president could have meetings with whomever he wants.” While stating that he “condemn[s] [Fuentes’s] ideology,” he stated also that “the president [didn’t] know who [Fuentes] was” instead of criticizing Trump’s silence. Leader McConnell, despite saying opaquely that “anyone” meeting with “people advocating that point of view” was unlikely to be elected president, didn’t rule out supporting Trump if he were to win the Republican nomination.

Perhaps the most direct Republican criticism was when Mike Pence said that “President Trump was wrong to give [Kanye and Fuentes] a seat at the table.” Pence then claimed that Trump did not hold the views of his guests. While Trump’s personal opinions may be difficult to determine, one thing should at least be clear: Trump sees no problem with endorsing hate for political gain.

The former president defended meeting Kanye on Truth Social, saying that he “appreciated all of the nice things [Kanye] said about me on ‘Tucker Carlson’” and asked “why wouldn’t I agree to meet?” Trump made no mention of Kanye’s championing of anti-Semitic hate speech. He embraced Kanye while Kanye was at the very center of the firestorm against his outrageous statements, and in doing so, Trump is normalizing hateful behavior as dangerous as Kanye’s.

Of course, this was far from the first time the former president had done so: this was the same president who said, from his very entry to the political stage in his 2015 presidential campaign announcement speech, that Mexico was sending “rapists” who were “bringing crime” and “bringing drugs” into the US. This was the same president who demonized Muslims in his 2016 campaign and called for the “complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the US. This was the same president who repeatedly referred to Covid as “Kung Flu,” claimed there were “good people on both sides” when white nationalists provoked violent riots in Charlottesville, and instructed the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” in a 2020 general election debate.

In short, little has changed with Trump hosting dinner for an outspoken anti-Semite and his Holocaust-denying friend. Regardless of what Trump’s personal opinions are, the dinner was an outrageous statement of hate against a minority group. Sadly, dining with Kanye, for Trump, adheres to normalcy instead of exception — and adds another controversy to former president Trump’s long legacy of endorsing hate.
