On September 18, 2022, just a few days before the five-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria, a storm which killed thousands in Puerto Rico, Hurricane Fiona, a classified Category Four Atlantic Hurricane, landed in Puerto Rico with wind speed reaching 90 mph and at least 30 inches of rainfall. The storm caused more than one million people without water and power, and at least 25 people have died.

Before the hurricane made landfall, on September 18, President Biden approved an Emergency Declaration for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, a legislation which authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide assistance for emergency measures to save and protect lives. Also, on September 21st, Biden approved a Major Disaster Declaration for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, authorizing individual and public assistance for hazard mitigation and impacted minicipalities. Recently, Biden also announced that $60 million in aid will be donated to Puerto Rico in order to help strengthen the infrastructure that has been destroyed by numerous flash floods and mudslides.

Whilst on his visit to Puerto Rico to assess the damage, Biden said, “We’re going to make sure you get every single dollar promised, and I’m determined to help Puerto Rico build faster than in the past and stronger.” Just before his departure back to the US, Biden acknowledged that the people of Puerto Rico have not been “taken very well taken care of,” promising to do everything he can to help replenish Puerto Rico’s wellbeing.

Although it seems as though Biden has already contributed a reasonable amount of aid to this natural disaster, there is still room for improvement. In order to assess the extent to which improvement can be done, it is always best to conduct a comparison.

In September 2017, Puerto Rico suffered from a Category Five Hurricane—Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Maria was regarded as the worst natural disaster in historical records to affect the islands of Saint Croix, Puerto Rico, and Dominica. It was the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017 and the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Hurricane Mitch in 1998. The monetary losses Hurricane Maria inflicted are estimated to be at least $91.61 billion, and there have been a total of 3,059 direct and indirect fatalities. Similar to Hurricane Fiona, Hurricane Maria caused Puerto Rico to suffer from widespread flooding, lack of resources, blackouts, etc.

Due to the severity of Maria, a lot of pressure was placed on the shoulders of the leaders who had the power to invoke beneficiary change. At the time in which Maria struck, the Trump administration held power in office, and in response to the hurricane, the administration promised $13 billion in federal disaster funding to repair the electrical and education infrastructures that were damaged. More specifically, $9.6 billion in federal funding was said to have been sent in order to aid the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority “repair and replace thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines, electrical substations, power generation systems [and] office buildings.” The other two billion was a grant towards Puerto Rico’s Department of Education that was meant to restore school buildings as well as other educational facilities. Whilst these plans of aid seem to have been extremely beneficiary, as opposed to immediately implementing aid, they sparked controversy instead.

In August of 2019, the Department of Housing and Urban Development put an abrupt hold on the billions of dollars of aid that were to be sent to Puerto Rico whilst simultaneously announcing the release of billions of dollars to other states that were hit by natural disasters. Such an unprecedented delay in releasing the well-needed funds angered many politicians, specifically congressional Democrats. Finally, in early 2020, the HUD released its controversial hold on the $8 billion in aid that was originally meant to be sent in September 2019. Nevertheless, the Trump administration’s slow recovery efforts resulted in criticism; in 2018, an internal FEMA report stated that the agency failed to adequately prepare for the previous year’s hurricane season and did not properly support the affected regions.

In terms of overall efficiency and effectiveness, it seems as though the Biden administration has certainly prevailed in providing more immediate aid towards the victims of Hurricane Fiona. Yet the destruction is far from being over, and it is a fixed truth that there are many more inevitable natural disasters yet to come. Therefore, whenever disaster spontaneously decides to strike, regardless of which administration is currently in power, hopefully said-leaders can learn from the mistakes of their predecessors to ensure that when responding to an immediate crisis, the safety and prosperity of those affected will always be protected.
