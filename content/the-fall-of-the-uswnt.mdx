Since their win over China in the 1999 World Cup, the US Women’s National Team(USWNT) has dominated the international soccer scene, winning three out of six World Cup titles, four out of six Olympic gold medals, and in 2019, defeating Thailand in a record-breaking 13-0. It seemed like no other country could match the sharp touches, skilled ball-handling, and finessed finishing of the stars and stripes. The USWNT had an expectation to win every game they played, and their fans expected a win every time the team stepped onto the pitch. Stars like Mia Hamm, Alex Morgan, Carli Lloyd, and Megan Rapinoe helped lead the USWNT to a national spotlight that previous women’s sports teams could only dream of.

**The United States’ reign can largely be attributed to Title IX**. Starting with the bill’s passage in 1972, in order to fill requirements for equal scholarship towards women’s sports, resources and energy were dumped into women’s teams that could house a large number of players. With common 25-person rosters, women’s soccer grew profoundly. With more players, competition levels increased. Unlike the soccer powerhouses of Germany, Italy, and France, the United States never had a dominant men’s team, so the USWNT became the soccer team of the nation.

Yet, despite the historical dominance of the USWNT, the October 7th defeat at the hands of the England Lionesses questions if a new era of women’s soccer has arrived. Even though the Lionesses only won 2-1, they dictated the game with superior pacing, unpredictable passing, and superb striking. And on October 11, the Spanish team beat USA 2-0. These two matches mark the first time since 2017 that the team has lost two games in a row. The sold out matches at Wembley during the women’s Euros in England this summer prove that the game is only growing, and the fierce play of the Lionesses against incredible competition should make US fans worried.

**But there is still hope.** After winning the 2019 world cup, new coach Vladko Andonovski had a quick turn-around in making a 28 average age team reach peak performance before the 2020 (2021) Olympics amidst a global pandemic. With the US’s bronze medal last year, it became evident that that steeper international competition guaranteed that the US could no longer just rely on skill and experience. The veteran team simply could not keep up with spry, shift competition. Evidently, as international competition increases, the team needs to find a balance between youth and experience.

The USWNT is rebuilding. The majority of the current roster was not on the winning 2019 team. Younger players such as Sophia Smith, Catarina Macario, and Trinity Rodman possess incredible skill. We cannot expect a new team to immediately click. The team now looks even better than it did half a year ago. **And with numerous players out from injuries and pregnancy, the USWNT will hopefully be better composed when the 2023 World Cup rolls around.**
