For the first time in Middlesex history, disc golf and pickleball are offered as fall sports this season. They are gender-inclusive, JV-level sports options. **With both being among the fastest growing sports in the United States, they have already garnered a significant level of enthusiasm on campus.**

Adding new sports to the fall season has been on the athletic department’s mind since before the Covid-19 pandemic. Although Middlesex’s enrollment has increased by roughly 60 students in the past 15 years, general athletic requirements have remained unchanged, leaving many teams––especially those at the sub-varsity level––“bursting at the seams in terms of enrollment,” according to Middlesex’s Athletic Director Ken Risley. As a result, the athletic department decided to create more sport options that emphasized inclusivity, fun, and team spirit. They also wanted to find sports that would be quick to learn and didn’t interfere with the current fall sports, conditions which made pickleball and disc golf ideal additions to the lineup.

As Risley and the athletic department were “[thinking] about the resources of the school,” they decided that these sports in particular would “allocate them well.” Pickleball plays on the tennis courts, utilizing an athletic space that is not typically used during the fall season. Disc golf takes unique advantage of Middlesex’s suburban New England setting and has a “really great relationship with nature,” according to Risley.

The pickleball team is coached by Matt Rose, a certified pickleball and tennis instructor. The team has 16 members—the maximum number of players possible on the roster. Compared to many other Middlesex teams, the pickleball team features a diverse group: from new students to returning upperclassmen, each at various skill levels, there’s truly a spot for everyone on the court. Ema Edwards ‘24, a devoted member of the pickleball team, stated that she has “learned a lot, and it’s only been a week or two.” She also believes pickleball is a great addition to the fall season because it seems like a sport she could “play later in life.” Both new sports are “fun alternatives for people that don't play the ‘mainstream’ sports,” she notes.

Disc golf sports a small-but-mighty six-player roster. John Jakutis is the head coach, and Chuck McDonald, a well-known member of the Technology Department, serves as assistant coach. Although no longer a member of the team, Sarah Custodio Guzman ‘26 joined to “try something new.” She loved how “passionate Coach J was…and loved meeting the people on the team.”

These sports are not only new to Middlesex, but also have gained new platforms in the broader high school sports scene. Edwards believes that the novelty of these sports allows them to bring together “open-minded people,” and **Mr. Risley concurs that “it takes courage to try something new”—a particularly resounding statement given Middlesex’s new mantra of curiosity, kindness, and courage.**

Nevertheless, many players wish that the teams could compete in interscholastic competition, an opportunity which neither one has had thus far. This is not completely surprising, however, given that these players and coaches are truly “pioneers in these sports,” as Risley notes; **most local schools simply don’t offer pickleball or disc golf as sport options, leaving Middlesex’s teams largely unrivaled.** There is still hope, though, as the athletic department anticipates the sports to increase in popularity over the next few years and will continue the search for competitors.

Even without competition, both pickleball and disc golf allow athletes with a wide variety of athletic experiences to engage in a supportive team environment. Risley believes that the sports are especially valuable additions to the fall season because they are accessible and “open to all.” Be on the lookout for Middlesex’s pickleball and disc golf domination in years to come.
