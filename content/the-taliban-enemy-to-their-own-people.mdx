The Minister of Higher Education, Neda Mohammad Nadeem, of Afghanistan’s Taliban government recently announced the ban of women from universities in Afghanistan, and that this regressive policy will take effect immediately.

The Taliban initially emerged in 1994, with many of their members being former Mujahideen fighters who were trained in Pakistan during Afghanistan’s civil war in the 1980s-1990s who later united with the intent of making Afghanistan an Islamic state.

During the Taliban’s 20th-century reign, they overtly denied women’s rights, enforcing their own twisted version of Islamic Sharia law. Women were essentially prisoners confined to their own homes; in Kabul, residents were forced to cover both their first-floor windows and their floor, so that women inside their homes could not be seen from the street. In order for a woman to leave the house, it was mandatory for her to wear a full body veil (burqa) and be accompanied by a male relative.

However, after the 9/11 attacks on the United States, the US international military campaign that intervened in Afghanistan raised global awareness about the dire need to improve Afghan women’s rights. Ultimately, the Taliban were removed from power by the end of 2001, prompting the gradual openings of schools to girls and workplaces to women.

Yet as we now know, the Taliban managed to crawl their way back into power. As of August 21, 2022, the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, ultimately eradicating the little progress that had been made to expand women’s rights.

As expected, the Taliban’s decree catalyzed a global backlash, as well as many protests inside of Afghanistan. Upon being turned away from campuses, numerous women congregated outside of Kabul University and protested in the first major public demonstration in Kabul ever since the initial announcement of the decision. Within Kabul, an estimated number of two dozen women marched down the streets, advocating for equality and freedom. Many chanted, “All or none. Don’t be afraid. We are together.”

In response to these protests, the government retaliated with violence. The Associated Press interviewed a woman who was an eye-witness to the chaos, and she claimed that the Taliban security used force to disband the protesters. “The girls were beaten and whipped,” she stated, “they also brought military women with them, whipping the girls. We ran away, some girls were arrested. I don’t know what will happen.”

Nevertheless, despite the backlash, Afghanistan's Minister of Higher Education fervently defended his decision, claiming that several issues pertaining Afghan women's behavior led to the decision. “We told girls to have proper hijab, but they didn’t, and they wore dresses like they are going to a wedding ceremony,” he said. “Girls were studying agriculture and engineering, but this didn’t match Afghan culture. Girls should learn, but not in areas that go against Islam and Afghan honor.”

The Taliban administration’s flagrant infringement on women’s rights has not only prompted women, but men, too, to protest and demand immediate change. In fact, in Nangarhar University in eastern Afghanistan, male medical students walked out of exams in protest against the exclusion of their female classmates. Moreover, numerous cricket players have publicly opposed the ban as well.

The upsurge in large-scale protesting is a rare phenomenon in Afghanistan, especially after the Taliban and its security agencies have taken over the country. However, the fact that an array of scattered protests continue to occur despite the numerous repercussions these protesters may face is concrete proof that these protestors are unhesitantly willing to fight back against any future attempts the Taliban might make to further reinstate archaic, conservative gender roles.
