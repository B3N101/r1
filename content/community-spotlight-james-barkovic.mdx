The Middlesex chapel is the embodiment of the word “enough.” Its facade is not overwhelming; rather, it’s charming in its visually pleasing simplicity. It’s not simple in the bland or dry sense––it is just plain and welcoming enough to direct attention to the wonderfully exciting and intricate Middlesex community it holds once a week. While the chapel has refined accents like towering pillars and glossy white woodwork, ultimately its beauty is just simple enough to create a space that accentuates the shining colors of the community inside.

The chapel represents community—a frequently overused word, yet an important one. In other words, it represents the idea of everyone bringing their own uniqueness to a place where such identity isn't just accepted but appreciated. But **the chapel could not represent our community without James Barkovic, an individual as fundamental to the chapel as the bricks and cement that build its walls.**

The average Middlesex student may know Barkovic’s face but perhaps not know where to place it. Barkovic is Middlesex's talented organist. As a young boy growing up in "Minnasotah" (as he recounts in his fabulous accent), James Barkovic always had a natural attraction to music and was musically skilled. From a young age, James’ parents witnessed him climbing upon their household piano and bashing on keys that he thought sounded good together. He comments that this occurrence "must have driven [his] mother crazy."

His interest in and adeptness with the piano sparked the next chapter of his musical life. A Brother at his local church recognized James’s potential and ended up giving James organ lessons for several years. From there on, James’s musical passion and talent took him to new horizons in the industry.

He expanded his skills, went to college for music, and worked at many gigs, lessons, and other music-related jobs in all the different places he has lived. **Currently, in addition to being Middlesex’s extraordinary organist, he juggles five other local jobs,** such as a choral teacher, a performing pianist, and an organist for local church, though he claims that he likes playing for Middlesex the best. In fact, he enjoys the senior chapels so much that he still remembers vividly a handful of them that stood out to him the most.

Barkovic notes that he sometimes plays modern, atypical songs such as pieces from the _Star Wars_ soundtrack "for fun." He mentions that sometimes students request songs that relate to their speeches, but in general, **by veering away from traditional chapel pieces and playing these fun songs, Barkovic embodies the personal authenticity that the Middlesex Chapel promotes**. Barkovic aims, through his weekly performances, to create an enthralling, safe, and reflective environment where everyone can pursue their purpose.

Barkovic plays the organ not only to challenge and entertain himself through the instrument’s fascinatingly complex construction of keys and pedals, but also because he loves to see the unity that he and his music can create. Barkovic strengthens the Middlesex community using his musical gift––a vital contribution which helps Middlesex students connect to music, relate to each other, ponder deep questions, and eventually begin to seek the gifts we have to offer.

The Middlesex chapel holds and embodies loads of exciting history, as it has had an important past long before any current students’ enrollment at Middlesex. Still, without a doubt, it will keep experiencing history as we make it, and James will have a special place in Middlesex’s corner of that history. For now, however, the Middlesex community is just lucky to have Barkovic’s presence and beautiful music at chapel each week.
