If I told you five years ago that the Los Angeles Lakers, led by LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook, would be the 12th seed in the Western Conference, while the Golden State Warriors, still led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, along with four new top-10 draft picks, would be only one game ahead of them, you would have laughed in my face and told me I was an idiot for multiple valid reasons. For one, how could these teams possibly assemble such insane talent onto one roster, and secondly, how on earth could such lineups lose even 10 games? Indeed, just two seasons ago, when the Brooklyn Nets added James Harden to their duo of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, many in the media asked, half jokingly, if we should just “fast-forward to the finals” between the Nets and Lakers. So how did these three teams manage to do the impossible, not once, but twice?

**When looking at the construction of the Lakers, Warriors, and Nets, there is one obvious difference between them and their peers: top-heavy team payrolls**. Of the Lakers’ approximately $170 million in active payroll to 14 total players, about $130 million (nearly 77%) is being dished out to only three members of the team, meaning that there is “only” (I speak relatively here) $40 million being paid to the remaining 11 players. Similarly, the Warriors’ and Nets’ top three players take up 65% and 64% of their teams’ salaries, respectively. Without getting into the abhorrent amount of money that all of these players make, it becomes clear that the key to **these teams’ failures lies in their dedication to pouring a massive portion of their available payroll into their superstars**. Then they have to rely on those superstars to consistently perform at a superior level in order to carry the flimsy role players and bench that the front office scraped together with the remaining salary. Thus, when someone like Russell Westbrook or Klay Thompson inevitably falls off with age or injury, their enormous contract remains, which is why the Lakers are now paying $47 million for a bench player averaging just over 11 points on some of the worst efficiency of Westbrook’s career. Meanwhile, the other two of the Lakers’ highest paid trio, LeBron and Davis, have been battling injuries throughout the season, stranding the LA squad with nobody to turn to for salvation. The same is true for the Warriors and Nets: If Curry, Durant, or Irving misses games, the teams are nearly helpless, becoming some of the worst lineups in the league.

The age of these wannabe “Big 3s” is the major factor in their failure. Other teams, like the Bucks and Nuggets, also pay a significant amount to their top three players and are thus left with scraps of backup salary. **However, the youth of their trios, combined with the minor help of having an averagely competent front office that can put together a solid lineup with limited resources, means that the teams don’t have to worry about their core stars missing extended periods or suddenly regressing.**

Meanwhile, teams that balance their salaries evenly throughout their rosters are seeing more consistent success. Though I wouldn’t go so far as to call the Indiana Pacers a successful or contending team, they are certainly outperforming the floor-level expectations set before the season began, hovering just below .500 and blowing out the Celtics as I write this. The Grizzlies, Kings, Knicks, and Mavericks, along with the Pacers, all hold serviceable records despite paying less than 50% of their total salary to their top three guys.

Much as I despise ending my articles like a Middlesex analytical essay, it is simply the most logical way to do so.

**While investing heavily in proven, veteran supertalent is a viable option to compete for championships, it lacks the stability and potential for growth that comes when a team invests more broadly in the team as a whole and builds a strong, complete lineup. That is the “A, but B” of not only basketball, but all modern sports.**
