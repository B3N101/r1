Year-to-date, the markets have seen a dramatic contraction in the prices of the equities, with the all-important S&P 500 index down over 22% at the time of writing, on October 7th, 2022, creating a bear market and leaving investors scrambling for alternative investments.

Much of this recent movement can be attributed to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Led by Chairman Jay Powell, **the Federal Reserve has acted quickly and decisively to combat rising inflation and concerns over the dollar.** The market has pulled back sharply in response to the Fed’s move, and many wonder if the Feds have perhaps overreacted and will unnecessarily constrain economic activity. In this article, I will explain what Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have done, and why I believe they have acted prudently.

In the past few months, Powell and his fellow members on the Board of Governors have raised the Federal funds rate, the interest the Federal charges on its uncollateralized overnight loans (meaning loans where the borrower need not put up any assets), from around 1% in early June to about 3.25%. These loans are mainly made to keep banks' capital reserves, a set amount of dollars that a bank holds in store to service withdrawals and other such activities, above the legal limit. As the feds-fund rate increases, the cost of borrowing increases for the banks, and that hike gets passed on to borrowers, making taking on debt more expensive, and thus making debt less attractive for businesses.

Markets usually revolt when this rate is increased, as businesses will hesitate to take on additional debt, and without the flow of debt, companies will have greater difficulty growing their enterprise. So why raise the Fed funds rate at all?

In case you are not yet familiar with inflation, **inflation is essentially an extension of supply vs. demand**. When the Fed, any central bank, or government prints more currency, more of that currency exists to buy the same number of goods and services; accordingly, the price of those goods and services increases to match the ability of the consumer to pay more. Currently, the US and most other countries are experiencing a historic inflation rate caused by massive demand from consumers, whose pockets are flushed an enormous amount of stimulus most governments pumped into the economy to keep the lights on during COVID-19, fighting over goods that are stuck in a nightmare supply chain crisis.

Thus, inflation grows as the money supply grows, and the Fed funds rate helps to limit the growth or even reduce the money supply, so the Federal Reserve raises the Fed funds rate to lower the inflation rate.

The Fed’s aggressive rate hikes and plans to continue represent the best possible path toward returning inflation to a healthy level most conducive to economic growth. **While the risk of a recession may be high, the perils of a permanent high inflation rate are simply too ghastly to ignore.** High inflation brutally robs wealth from all Americans, as they are forced to sit back and watch helplessly as their purchasing power is slowly drained. The rate hike is a good thing to break the economy’s fix on cheap money, weaken the speculative fervor that has driven markets of late, and enhance US credibility abroad. Already, the US dollar has gone on a tremendous tear in foreign markets as a result of the Fed’s policy. Proof that this strategy to combat rampant inflation already exists; back in the 1980s, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker dramatically raised the Fed funds rate, creating a recession, but also returning inflation to normal levels, creating the right conditions for explosive growth in the following years.

It remains to be seen whether Powell will be able to avoid a recession whilst also lowering inflation, and he continues to suffer from Congress and Biden’s exorbitant spending that undermine Fed policy and grow the money supply, but in general, the Fed is taking the properly aggressive, brave approach to combating inflation and should be commended for not bowing down to the incessant demands of a cheap-credit crazed Wall Street.
