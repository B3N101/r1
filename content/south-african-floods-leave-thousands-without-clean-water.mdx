As a result of the ongoing effects of climate change, natural disasters are becoming more frequent and more powerful––and, by extension, more destructive. In the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, a recent torrential downpour created floods that killed over 435 people, destroyed thousands of homes, and wreaked over $1.57 billion in structural damage. They also cut off the supply of clean water to thousands of people, a reality which jeopardized each of their lives.

The flood destroyed the waterwork systems in many areas, leaving residents in and around the inner city with no water. Tongaat, a small town within KwaZulu-Natal, has a population of 42,554, consisting mostly of elders. The majority identify as Black or South Asian. **As is all too common in the aftermath of natural disasters, communities suffering long-term consequences from the flood consist of marginalized, non-white individuals**.

Residents of Village Park, a complex located in Tongaat, shared their experiences from the flood and gave a glimpse into what a future with limited water looks like.

To bring water into the complex, tankers, known as “Jojo tanks” in South Africa, fill up local water tanks. Residents then travel to the water tanks, fill up their bottles and containers, and make the journey back to their homes. “The municipality doesn’t have that many tankers for Tongaat,” reported one resident, “they got about 25… Maybe 35 tankers. They allocated tankers in certain areas…**You are allocated your 250 liters, you use it, and that’s it for the day**.” Another resident shared that “it’s hard because we’re seniors and we have to get water every day. It makes our chests pain. Our stomachs pain. There is not enough water to have a bath…you’re not free to do anything you want to do… We can’t carry big buckets.” Another community member noted that “Even when we got the tankers here, it’s a mission to bring water into the complex. There’s not enough tankers to go around. The people are finding this difficult to cope with. They’re making the most of what is available. Hopefully we will have water restoration in a few months. Let’s hope it comes to an end.”

“There’s no time,” said another resident, “I get up at 4, sort out all the water for my kids and then I leave for work and come back at 4:30. I still have to carry water every day in the dark to wash clothes and dishes and have a bath. Since this water crisis I only have 1 meal a day… You need water to be alive.” She later shares, “I’m getting calluses on my fingers from carrying those buckets. On Thursday night my whole hand was swollen. My son is young and I don't want him to get hurt. That’s life without water.”

**After over 5 months with no running water, the people of KwaZulu-Natal have come up with innovative ways to combat their struggles**. A recent invention called the “immersion geyser,” a device which heats large amounts of water using a metal heating rod and a plastic bucket, has become a widespread necessity. Although it may not be as safe as other alternatives, it is accessible and effective.

The past few months have been tremendously challenging for people living in KwaZulu-Natal, and the water supply is not expected to be restored until December, probably for only a few hours a day at first. Even after facing such atrocities, however, locals refuse to give up hope. As global warming heightens, the residents of Village Park exemplify both the crisis’s detrimental consequences and the determined innovation that will be necessary to make vital progress towards a more ecological world.
