Andrew Tate. An American-British influencer and former professional kickboxer. Yet, his past athletic skill was not the sole reason as to why he rose to popularity, but rather his controversial views and similarly questionable actions. His notoriety arose from a video depicting him beating a woman with a belt in the U.K. franchise Big Brother. 

Many view Tate to be a misogynist who does not deserve his large platforms of 178,000 subscribers on Youtube, 4.7 million followers on Instagram, and 4.4 million followers on Twitter. He continuously claims that women should remain in their distinctive spheres: women belong in the home, can’t drive, and are men’s property. 

Due to the degrading, offensive nature of Tate’s social image, he has been banned from Youtube, Tiktok, Instagram, and Facebook. Nevertheless, his impact remains prominent both online and in the lives of many. 

Donald Trump. An equally—maybe even more—controversial figure who served as America’s 45th U.S. President. From calling Mexicans “criminals” in a 2015 Presidential bid to claiming that “[Democrats] are trying to steal the [2020] election” to blaming the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak on people of Chinese descent, the grand majority of people have developed a distaste towards Trump and his xenophobic and misogynistic ideals.

So what do these two figures with completely different careers have in common? Well, it was their same controversial, disruptive images that led Twitter to remove their accounts from its platform. However, after purchasing Twitter for $44 billion, Elon Musk recently made the unprecedented decision to unban these accounts, sparking widespread confusion and conflict throughout all social media platforms. 

Yet, unbanning Tate and Trump’s accounts was not the only contentious decision Elon Musk has made. Early last November, Musk fired the entirety of Twitter’s human rights team.  More specifically, he fired several long-time executives, including Vijaya Gadde—the head of legal policy, trust, and safety who played an important role in banning Trump from Twitter. 

While Musk admits that the situation is a regrettable one, he firmly stands by his decision, claiming that “we recognize that this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions to Twitter, but this action is unfortunately necessary to ensure the company’s success moving forward.” 

Musk’s actions of both permitting figures who share repugnant ideologies to exist on Twitter and removing the Human Rights and Censorship divisions, crucial sectors that were put in place to maintain the safety of Twitter users, have resulted in numerous people beginning to question if these actions that seem to promote biased ideals are a reflection of Musk’s true character–or if Musk is intentionally increasing the prominence of hate speech. 

Ever since Musk’s takeover of Twitter, Twitter has lost nearly a million accounts.

However, while there has been a decrease in the number of people active on Twitter, there has been an unsurprisingly influx of hate speech. Twitter reported a 500% increase in the use of the N-word within a mere 12-hour window upon the shift of ownership to Musk. 

Consequently, the number of tweets using the word “Jew” have increased nearly fivefold—many of these tweets were extremely antisemitic. Not only that, but there has been an upsurge in the prevalence of transphobic and misogynistic language, most accredited to trolling campaigns on websites including the pro-Trump forum The Donald as well as 4chan.

These recent moderations have ultimately hindered the ability of marginalized peoples to find a safe haven or community in which they feel protected whilst using Twitter. Currently, there is hardly any concrete way for said marginalized groups to protect themselves from this increasing hate speech and trauma. 

Instead of attempting to create solutions to cease this widespread fear spreading throughout nearly the entire Twitter platform, Musk has only decided to continue to loosen Twitter’s moderation guidelines. This blatant disregard for oppressed peoples’ safety and comfort undoubtedly highlights Musk’s privilege as a cis-white male to not have any regard for marginalized peoples, as well as his privilege as a wealthy elite, who uses his authority to suit the desires of not the people, but himself.
