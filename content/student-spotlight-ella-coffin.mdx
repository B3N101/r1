The start of a new school year offers Middlesex students the unique opportunity to make new connections, but the packed schedule leaves little room for really getting to know those around you. The semester is almost halfway done and many people still remain unacquainted with each other. With such a small student body, one would assume it would be easy to make new connections, but between classes, athletics, and evening activities, it can be difficult to meet new people. Take Ella Coffin, ’24 for example. You might occasionally wave at her in the hallway or see her during athletics, but what’s her story?

“I was doing research about boarding schools and I came across Middlesex. I liked the sound of it because you can do arts and sports and you learn a lot here,” Ella shares. “I still need to figure out how to adjust in a way that I can get all of my work done in a good amount of time.”

Ella is quite intellectually passionate. For example, she describes that she is thrilled to take a philosophy class in the spring semester. She explains, “last year, my math teacher had a quote of the week which was always something from a philosopher, which got me interested in philosophy class.”

Although Ella shows large interest in the academic opportunities at Middlesex, she’s also very involved with the athletic program. “I really like the cross country team,” she shares. “It’s a lot of fun. It’s a new sport for me because I played soccer most of my life. I think all the sports teams in general here are a good way to get to know people.” Ella’s athletic interests keep her busy all-year round.

Ella also has a twin brother who attends Hotchkiss School and is currently studying abroad in France. Her parents live in Manhattan, but are preparing for the 4-hour journey to Concord for family weekend. **“I miss my friends in New York but I enjoy living the Middlesex life. It’s a change of pace in a good way. I’m in BP, which is a lot of fun. Best dorm on campus,**” Ella adds.

Outside of school, Ella loves sailing: she has family members that live on Pelican Lake in Minnesota, where she spends most of her summers. “I’ve been taking sailing classes there since I was 9, but this summer I started teaching there. Knowing how to sail well and knowing how to teach sailing well are two different things.” Additionally, **even though she’s a new student, Ella has already tried out an impressive amount of clubs**, from writing for _The Anvil_ to attending Filmmaking Club to aiding in Common Sense’s projects. She explains, “I decided to do it as a way to get to know people,” and later adds, “I think I enjoy trying new things in general, which is lots of the reason I came here, too.”

After only being here for a few weeks, **Ella has clearly embraced Middlesex life with open arms.** She is thrilled to be a part of the tightly knit bonds of the Middlesex community.
