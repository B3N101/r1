On Thursday, September 1st, Biden addressed the nation in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The setup of his address was striking: the background was blood red, the Marine Band was playing “Hail to the Chief,” and a pair of Marine sentries stood rigidly in the backdrop. The location itself, Independence Hall, was also carefully selected, as it is the landmark for many famous events in American history. 

Independence Hall was where the Declaration of Independence was signed in July 1776, where the Founding Fathers debated and wrote the Constitution in 1787, where the Liberty Bell rang, and where George Washington was named the commander in chief of the continental army at the start of the Revolutionary War. Independence Hall has seen its fair share of speeches, from JFK in 1962, to Ford in 1976, and then Reagan in 1987.

This speech stood in stark contrast to his inaugural address, where Biden emphasized the importance of bipartisanship and national unity. In the speech, Biden warned that “equality and democracy are under assault” in America due to Donald Trump and his Make America Great Again (MAGA) supporters. Throughout the speech, Biden targeted radical republicans, calling them an extremist threat to the country who are “determined to take the country backward” and “promote[ers of] authoritarian leaders [who] fan the flames of political violence.” However, Biden still attempted to maintain bipartisanship as he emphasized that “not every republican, not even the majority of republicans are MAGA republicans,” asserting that the MAGA republicans are a small yet dangerous faction of the party. While Biden did not look to alienate half the country, as he repeatedly held back in his speech mentioning that “there are far more Americans from every background and beliefs who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those who accept it,” the address overall was still a significant deviation from Biden’s typical stance of placating all parties and reaching across the aisle. Many critics called the speech overly decisive. For example, Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy accused Biden of trying to divide Americans through this speech, as the speech was overly partisan compared to the rest of Biden’s addresses to the nation. 

On the whole, though, the speech itself was a campaign stunt meant to increase voter turnout in favor of Democrats ahead of the November midterm elections, for Biden framed the midterm elections as the battle for the “soul of the nation'' in one of the most memorable portions of his speech. To battle for the “soul of the nation,” Biden pushed Americans to go out on election day to “vote, vote, and vote,” as “for a long time, we’ve reassured ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed. But it is not.” It remains to be seen how effective Biden and the Democrats’ tactics are in increasing democratic voter turnout before the 2022 midterm elections, but whatever the outcome, Biden’s “soul of the nation” speech is arguably one of the best-delivered speeches so far in his presidency.
